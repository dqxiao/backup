1	If subfamilies are to be accepted in the Phalacrocoracidae, the Pelagic Shag and its relatives would go in the Phalacrocoracinae like most Northern Hemisphere cormorants and shags, while Leucocarboninae would include mainly Southern Hemisphere taxa.. In this model, the length of a giraffe s neck would be explained by positing that proto-giraffes with longer necks would have had a significant reproductive advantage to those with shorter necks.\r\n	9223988173	2009-08-12 13:14:51
2	junipers and other conifers from more than. The Actitis species have a distinctive stiff-winged flight low over the water..\r\n	7450253854	2010-09-26 16:59:29
3	These banding programs yield valuable data about migration patterns, harvest rates, and survival rates.. This species is included on CITES App.\r\n	9815553109	2009-07-17 15:25:30
4	Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod dinosaurs had feathers, contribute to this ambiguity.. The origin of the name scaup may stem from the bird s preference for feeding on scalp  the Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels; however, some credit it to the female s discordant scaup call as the name s source.\r\n	6094872035	2009-05-15 11:43:18
5	At 70100 days of age, chicks tend to leave the group and become independent. The largest species is the Southern Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), reaching sizes of as much as 6.2 kg (14 lb) and 1.3 m (4.3 ft) in length.\r\n	4880169499	2009-07-26 17:23:12
6	When two named species are discovered to be of the same species, the older species name is usually retained, and the newer species name dropped, a process called synonymization, or colloquially, as lumping. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day.\r\n	8041486344	2010-06-26 11:49:41
7	measures to keep birds from adapting to new. Whiskered Auklets feed in the inshore zone, usually within 16 km of land, where tidal currents concentrate their prey into dense swarms.\r\n	0716278341	2010-08-17 23:55:16
8	A culturally significant hybrid between the Red Junglefowl and the Green Junglefowl in Indonesia is known as the Bekisar.. Natural migrants to Japan usually occur along with Whooper and sometimes Bewick s Swans..\r\n	9046340088	2010-06-27 15:44:28
9	Brain structures involved in both pathways show sexual dimorphism in many bird species, usually causing males and females to sing differently. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey..\r\n	4566698751	2010-05-11 16:41:16
10	Numenius is classed in the family Scolopacidae. Length is 1825 cm (7.19.8 in), wingspan is 3041 cm (1216 in) and weight is 3373 g (1.22.6 oz).\r\n	0923884998	2010-03-26 21:31:26
11	In plants, polyploidy is extremely commonplace with few restrictions on interbreeding; as individuals with an odd number of chromosome sets are usually sterile, depending on the actual number of chromosome sets present, this results in the odd situation where some individuals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with certain others and some cannot, with all populations being eventually linked as to form a common gene pool.. The courtship displays of Swainson s Hawk are not well known.\r\n	4447293678	2010-10-27 16:46:15
12	The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. It benefits from deforestation and some agriculture.\r\n	2647859755	2009-07-26 11:48:27
13	Immatures are similar except for small white spots on the breast and tails with narrow gray and black bands and a broad dark tip. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and Tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds..\r\n	3937642446	2009-02-19 23:28:13
14	It seems to be quite tolerant of conspecifics from adjacent territories.. It is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay, particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use.\r\n	4921529832	2009-02-20 11:11:24
15	In South Australia, nesting sites on the Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island are vulnerable to unmanaged coastal recreation and encroaching urban development.. The earliest Swainson s Hawks arrive in southern Canada in late March, with migration peaking from mid April onwards..\r\n	1446209891	2010-02-17 19:43:37
16	For a long time, it was thought that the dark phase of the present bird was a distinct species Buteo fuliginosus. They had been used for this purpose since at least the 17th century but in the 19th century it became a major craze and the number of egret skins passing through dealers reached into the millions.\r\n	1855630061	2009-09-26 19:30:25
17	Most specialist insect eaters outside the tropics are long-distance migrants, and have little choice but to head south in winter.. The twig nest is built low in a tree, and three or four large white eggs are laid.\r\n	3670938074	2010-08-22 17:42:38
18	This bird is closely related to the more widespread Red Knot. The area a nest occupies grows throughout the breeding season as the breeding pairs throw their excrement outside the nest..\r\n	3980238377	2010-03-11 11:54:58
19	On the 7th of February 2004, 2.5 million Oriental Pratincoles were recorded on Eighty Mile Beach in Australia s north-west by the Australasian Wader Studies Group. How far this would deter predators is not known..\r\n	7316816682	2009-08-14 15:18:39
20	Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. Same-sex pairing has also been shown in several families of true seabirds including the petrels and shearwaters.\r\n	6484200583	2009-03-21 11:44:58
21	In some areas, though, the breeding success rate is considerably greater and, occasionally, all cygnets may reach maturity. Their breeding habitats are forested areas.\r\n	8506591302	2009-01-14 14:35:11
22	The classification of species has been profoundly affected by technological advances that have allowed researchers to determine relatedness based on molecular markers, starting with the comparatively crude blood plasma precipitation assays in the mid-20th century to Charles Sibley s ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization studies in the 1970s leading to DNA sequencing techniques. Staying up longest does not necessarily mean going farthest.\r\n	7899304218	2010-06-18 13:27:11
23	The rattling of the tail and the shaking of the wings helped in keeping the attention of females.. In Sweden, breeders are usually found in small, swampy openings amongst pine forests while, in Germany, marshy wetlands are used.\r\n	5792770013	2009-01-17 14:54:38
24	Breeding birds have two long feathers on the sides of the nape. Using their beaks to pull material towards them, they fashion a cone-shaped pile of mud between 1546 cm (618 in) tall, with a small depression in the top to house their single egg.\r\n	6286856025	2010-05-20 10:58:41
25	The bill is pink with blue to violet at the base and the distal third black, the legs are greenish and rather short, and there is a fairly big area of bare bluish skin around the eye.. At the heart of their range, there is a tendency to travel in flocks over the winter months, though this behavior is not a true long-range migration but rather local dispersal..\r\n	3369410416	2009-10-21 22:12:13
26	Incubation lasts for around 28 to 35 days and typically the female incubates, while being fed by the male, although the male may occasionally incubate. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.\r\n	8535411849	2009-12-23 13:18:34
27	When the penguins are breeding, incubation takes 3840 days with both parents helping out. In fact, it makes up a significant portion (sometimes a majority) of the diet in winter, when ground squirrels are in hibernation and rabbits and hares tend to be at population lows.\r\n	5348956428	2009-08-14 12:17:27
28	Aggressive actions such as attacking, talon-grasping, and pursuit have been noted by some observers. Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus Eurypyga.\r\n	1902346389	2009-06-17 14:42:50
29	The usual call is a rapid series of three short fluty notes syllabilized as teu-teu-teu.. Small Cackling Goose (Branta hutchinsii minima).\r\n	0556254281	2010-09-22 19:45:56
30	They disappeared apparently no later than about 8000 BC, soon after the start of human settlement, which may also have contributed to the local extinction.. Burrow nests are particularly common among seabirds at high latitudes, as they provide protection against both cold temperatures and predators.\r\n	0164622141	2009-02-18 22:38:51
31	The name is also spelt Kaleege in old texts, such as Game Birds of India and Asia by Frank Finn, though no longer in his Indian Sporting Birds. They appear to be more closely associated to water than chukars are, and in drier areas..\r\n	8055329526	2009-02-13 19:30:42
32	It differs from the first of those species in a smaller and less contrasting white rump patch, while the Solitary Sandpiper has no white rump patch at all.. A major cause of Swainson s Hawk population decline was pesticide use in its wintering grounds of Argentina.\r\n	9036621362	2009-08-17 12:41:31
33	It incorporates some plant material and with a grass lining. Fortunately, they are well equipped to survive the task and bring winged enjoyment back to birder s yards year after year..\r\n	1224303266	2010-03-22 16:47:32
34	Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating Ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The goal of this project was the reestablishment of the Harpy Eagle within Belize.\r\n	8648327880	2009-11-12 13:28:42
35	The Tacarcuna Wood Quail (Odontophorus dialeucos) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. They are sedentary, or nomadic following food sources.\r\n	7133754565	2009-02-20 11:47:25
36	Some of the known types of dimorphisms in the brain include the size of nuclei, the number of neurons present, and the number of neurons connecting one nucleus to another. Moderately sized species, including larger Anas ducks such as Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese such as Bean Goose (Anser fabalis) are perhaps most often recorded.\r\n	0352570534	2009-01-10 19:38:24
37	It attends these colonies nocturnally, although non-breeding Wedge-tails are often seen at the surface throughout the day and breeding birds will rest outside their burrows before laying.. Egg survival has been measured at 28% and nestling survival at 40%; storms that destroy nests are an important cause of losses.\r\n	9663085448	2010-05-11 18:24:56
38	The darters have completely webbed feet, and their legs are short and set far back on the body..

104	Great Tinamou lives in subtropical and tropical forest such as rainforest, lowland evergreen forest, river-edge forest, swamp forest and cloud forest at altitudes from 3001,500 m (1,0004,900 ft). Predators of eggs and nestlings include Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura), Common Ravens (Corvus corax) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Despite their stout appearance, shovelers are nimble fliers.. Males weigh on average 7.3 kg (16 lb), while females weigh 6.2 kg (14 lb) on average (Erickson, 1976).\r\n	9837217134	2010-03-27 13:53:16
105	Its diet includes cephalopods and prawns and it sometimes associates with other members of the order Procellariiformes as it fishes. These birds were the subject of one of the first ever bird protection laws, established by Saint Cuthbert in the year 676. Calls are also made on flight, when a female is away form then territory too long or if a male cant find a chick..

106	If the parent Blue-footed Booby does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive.. In Cumbria, young Golden Eagles were first seen hunting large prey 59 days after fledging and 75 to 85 days after fledging the young were largely independent of parents. The shape or color of the culmen can also help with the identification of birds in the field. The nests are constructed between 4-6 m off ground during a maximum of six days and are oval,.\r\n	9084142416	2009-01-17 15:35:13
107	The Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture is a scavenger and subsists almost entirely on carrion. In the late 1930s, studies showed that four-fifths of the food eaten by Canvasbacks was plant material. In the water, it feeds from silt at the bottom of the body of water. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida.\r\n	5127510476	2009-06-25 14:21:35

They measure 2022 cm (7.98.7 in) in length and 4246 cm (1718 in) across the wings, and weight is from 50105 g (1.83.7 oz).. The eyes are tube shaped and cannot move much in their sockets. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation.\r\n	1868729658	2009-02-26 14:51:24
109	Hunting, sometimes assumed to have played a major part, probably was not significant as the bird was protected by a kapu which prohibited hunting except by ali?i until 1819 . While the variety of habitat types in which it is found suggests that it is not particularly susceptible to changes in land use, it is apparently still a rare and local species almost anywhere in its range. However, these conspecific species follow no set  rules . They are preyed upon by many avian (including hawks, egrets, and herons) and mammalian (including foxes and cats) predators and rely on the cover of thick marsh vegetation for protection.\r\n	6804112789	2009-03-25 11:14:50
110	In one instance, a Golden Eagle trying to hunt some wildcat kittens was intercepted by the mother wildcat. A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water. Thus, the White-tailed may locally outcompete the Golden Eagle in terms of populating a given area. Elsewhere, it may prefer the red berries of Chione trees..\r\n	8814331781	2009-05-17 18:45:27
111	The positioning of the egret s eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that the species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. The southern African Greater Striped Swallow, and the Australian Satin Flycatcher, Dollarbird, and Rainbow Bee-eater for example, winters well north of their breeding range.. In the United States there is a small and endangered breeding population in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, along with a recently discovered rookery in southeastern North Carolina. The female lays 312 eggs, with 4 to 6 being average, in a mound of plant material on a small island, a beaver or muskrat lodge, or a floating platform on a clump of emergent vegetation.\r\n	1685017712	2009-08-17 20:28:26
112	Each bird stays within a fairly small area. In flight, where the relatively short legs do not extend beyond the tail (unlike e.g. All cormorants have preen gland secretions that are used ostensibly to keep the feathers waterproof. The 2010 American Scaup population survey was 4.2 million Scaup, however, the worldwide Greater Scaup population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature Greater Scaup.\r\n	5054608504	2009-01-14 10:52:52
113	The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams. The female is a brown bird with pale cheeks, very similar to female Black Scoter.. The Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) is a goose with a black head and neck, white patches on the face, and a brown body. The breeding male Mallard is unmistakable, with a glossy bottle-green head and white collar which demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey brown wings, and a pale grey belly.\r\n	7870156499	2009-08-18 15:36:26
114	The eggs and young chicks are vulnerable to these predators, but adults are generally safe. The best opportunity to see a Black Rail is during an extremely high tide when the birds are forced out of the coastal marshes into nearby fields and brush for cover. During their flight displays the male will begin by diving toward the female. habitat for wading birds and migratory shorebirds..\r\n	6769308574	2010-04-14 17:41:46
115	Soil plays a different role in the burrow nest; here, the eggs and youngand in most cases the incubating parent birdare sheltered under the earth. The 1971 Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary describes the use of  shitepoke  for the small green heron of North America (Butorides virescens) as originating in the United States, citing a published example from 1853. A contemporary novel by Roger Real Drouin, No Other Way, concerns a nature photographer seeking a northern curlew and was published in 2012 by Moonshine Cove Publishing. Notably, it had been underreported in Flores and Paysand Departments, where it seems in fact to be a regular visitor.\r\n	7764604326	2009-03-22 10:52:39

Further analysis revealed that the kidneys had the highest levels of cadmium, the liver had the highest levels of copper and manganese, the liver and the stomach had the highest levels of zinc, and the lungs and liver had the highest levels of iron. Chicks that are left unattended are often attacked and killed by other northern gannets.. A bird s skeleton comprises only about 5% of its total body weight.\r\n	4830831265	2010-03-17 23:55:51
119	The American Oystercatcher has distinctive black and white plumage and a long, bright orange beak. Same-sex pairing has also been shown in several families of true seabirds including the petrels and shearwaters. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel. Air flows interiorly (caudal to cranial) through the parallel, honeycombed walls of the parabronchi into air vesicles, called atria, which project radially through the parabronchi.\r\n	7337245456	2010-12-19 15:44:38

Around the Himalayas, the small White-bellied musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) is reportedly a favorite prey item (though no quantitative analysis are known). The Smew lives on fish-rich lakes and slow rivers. The Steller s Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) of Asia s North Pacific, at unconfirmed weights of up to 12.7 kg (28 lb) and an average weight of 6.7 kg (15 lb), is regarded as the heaviest eagle.\r\n	6893553340	2010-10-24 19:44:12
122	The only other very large, long-legged white birds in North America are: the Great Egret, which is over a foot shorter and one-seventh the weight of this crane; the Great White Heron, which is a morph of the Great Blue Heron in Florida; and the Wood Stork. The breeding season of the Bonin Petrel in Hawaii is timed to avoid that of the Wedge-tail; in years where Bonin Petrel chicks are still in burrows when Wedge-tails return to begin breeding these chicks are killed or evicted. The Common Sandpiper breeds across most of temperate and subtropical Europe and Asia, and migrates to Africa, southern Asia and Australia in winter. Their breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or flats across northern Canada and Alaska.\r\n	7328606252	2010-07-15 12:26:34
123	Although this latter population has not been formally assigned to a race, the probability that it belongs with A. They had been used for this purpose since at least the 17th century but in the 19th century it became a major craze and the number of egret skins passing through dealers reached into the millions. Bewick s Swan is one of the birds to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.. They will join with flocks of the American Wigeon in the United States, and they also hybridize with them.\r\n	7402547353	2010-09-13 13:42:16
124	Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The leading edge of the inner wing is black. Nesting success at burned territories in Snake River Canyon declined after major fires. The individual prey item is apparently selected in a manner of seconds before the strike.\r\n	6354129025	2009-09-11 20:30:47
125	The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), and in some areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most widespread of the New World vultures. Elbowbush was the single most important source, followed by Roemer acacia (Acacia roemeriana), desert-yaupon (Schaefferia cuneifolia), and spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida).. They have been known to rob nests and may supplement their diet with small mammals such as chipmunks, hares, mice, squirrels, and bats. As their common name implies, the Tundra Swan breeds in the Arctic and subarctic tundra, where they inhabit shallow pools, lakes and rivers.\r\n	4719921304	2009-11-13 15:18:28
126	thoracicus in mainland China and B. There is some speculation that it may feed cooperatively in pairs, as it is almost always observed in pairs, even during the non-breeding season. The tomia (singular  tomium ) are the cutting edges of the two mandibles. The Whooper Swan is similar in appearance to the Bewick s Swan.\r\n	6494068927	2009-11-15 11:27:15
127	The European Rabbit appears to be secondary in Hungary, where it comprised 14.3%.. Habitat degradation is the major threat to this bird, since they depend on very limited coastal habitat on their wintering grounds, and very specific habitat in their boreal breeding grounds. The island homes of the duck are especially vulnerable to a rise in sea level and extreme weather associated with global warming. An increase in hemoglobin would correspond with an adults increase in metabolic needs.\r\n	8160009942	2010-02-15 16:13:13
128	Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Clutch size can also vary with the age of the hen. 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 150 mol/L. In one study it was found that 90% of the buds of the Alaska willow within their reach had been browsed.\r\n	5408013752	2009-05-15 16:51:32
129	Scripps s Murrelet is mainly threatened by oil spills, as much of its population lives near the busy shipping lanes connecting Los Angeles to other ports. Synchronous laying of eggs is found in Atlantic Puffins in adjacent burrows. In Florida, bobcats have caused the great majority of mortalities among Whooping Cranes, including several adults and the first chick documented to be born in the wild in 60 years. Fire suppression, tree plantings, limiting logging practices, and an increase of invasive woody species have also led to habitat fragmentation.\r\n	4286443667	2009-07-28 18:13:45
130	This section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably. Incubation is by the female alone, and the time to hatching is 2023 days, with a further 2528 days to fledging. Buller s Shearwater can also be found to breed in cracked-up rock on treeless stacks or cliffs however, and most of the other colonies  on the smaller Poor Knights islands between the main islands and off the southeast of Aorangi[verification needed]  are of such a nature. It mostly eats insects and other small invertebrates..\r\n	2321737167	2010-02-23 23:45:13
131	Named by Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1892, the Laysan Duck is named after Laysan island, one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The Atlantic Puffin has a black crown and back, pale grey cheek patches and white underparts. Only in severe storms might this species be pushed into headlands. It is difficult to determine the sex of an adult American White Ibis from its external appearance, since the sexes have similar plumage.\r\n	5317195219	2010-02-15 18:47:37
132	This species was described from specimens brought back to Europe from trading expeditions in the early sixteenth century. However, most have a preference for a certain type of prey which in harriers and the numerous buteonine hawks tends towards small mammals such as rodents. Young pelicans may be hunted by Great Horned Owls and Bald Eagles. Much more research needs to be done before the artificial wetlands can match the natural wetlands, and provide an acceptable habitat for the Falcated Duck..\r\n	7021212465	2009-01-18 22:46:45
133	They nest in cavities in trees, also in burrows or protected sites on the ground. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around five or six years of age. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations and people in the fishing industry are all working .. The head, neck and body are white; a small crest forms a black spot on top of the head, and the area around the eyes, particularly towards the bill, is also black.\r\n	9053636395	2009-11-17 14:15:41
134	They have greyish legs as in the Kalij Pheasant, but their plumage is closer to that of some subspecies of the Silver Pheasant. In Montana, it was found that most predation on lambs by Golden Eagles was committed by juvenile eagles or eagles that failed to breed (which have no need to carry prey to a nest). They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.. Unpaired ducks showing up on breeding grounds will most likely end up being non-breeders.\r\n	4089008646	2010-04-23 11:35:25
135	Steppe Buzzard is some times split as a separate species, B. In Australia it is mainly sedentary and found patchily around the coastline, though it is a non-breeding visitor to eastern Victoria and Tasmania. Coastal communities and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made good use of the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. The Turkey Vulture is awkward on the ground with an ungainly, hopping walk.\r\n	8552801121	2009-02-23 20:14:32
136	Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days (longer for the larger albatrosses), the longest incubation period of any bird. But in fact, it is a true bittern, having like these only 10 rectrices (other Ardeidae have 12) and being unequivocally placed in the bittern lineage by DNA sequence data too. The White-bellied Chachalaca (Ortalis leucogastra) is a species of bird in the Cracidae family. Additionally, the grasp is 94 to 125 mm (3.7 to 4.9 in) and the third toe 29.5 to 45 mm (1.16 to 1.77 in), indicating that the Ferruginous Hawks has the largest and most robust feet of any of the world s Buteos.\r\n	4843520797	2010-09-22 22:38:58
137	It typically feeds alone or in pairs, but is sometimes seen in groups up to 100, especially before roosting for the night.. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. The male usually passes off food to the female, which she then feeds to the young, although later the female will capture food and simply drop into the nest for her nestlings to eat. Its breeding range extends from the western USA south through Mexico, as well as from southeastern Brazil and southeastern Bolivia south to central Argentina, and along the coast of central Chile.\r\n	7855327720	2009-06-14 13:51:20
138	Rather, the similarities in skull morphology reflect convergent evolution to cope with the different challenges of daytime and nighttime feeding. Verification of subspecies status would require DNA sequence analyses however, since the differences in morphology are not large and there is much variation between individuals.. Adult Japanese Golden Eagles often maintain extensive white mottling on the inner-webs of the tail that tend to be more typical of juvenile eagles in other races.. The body mass of females can range from 11.3 kg (2.22.9 lb)..\r\n	2873278345	2009-03-16 10:44:57
139	The Hyacinth Macaw is largest parrot. The  conversion of flooded taro fields to dry sugar-cane acreage  destroys parts of this species  habitat.. Andean Flamingos filter surface water for food, but borax mining pollutes this water. The adult male Tiny Hawk is dark slaty gray above, with a mottled gray face, a paler gray supercilium, and a blackish crown and nape.\r\n	7731812047	2009-09-25 16:13:24
185	Birds may also be found off the mainland such as in the Canary Islands. However, they are smaller on average than Bald Eagle nests.\r\n	2471907628	2010-09-18 17:45:48
186	In the southern United States, it commences in March, peaks in April to May, and continues into June. Ground squirrels are generally quite social animals and some species even live in cohesive colonies.\r\n	2602085758	2010-02-17 18:25:50
140	The Intermediate tends to stalk upright with neck extended forward. The fossil records of boobies are not as well documented as those of the gannets; possibly because the species of boobies were less numerous in the late Miocene to Pliocene, when gannets had their highest diversity or because of the more tropical distribution of boobies, many fossil species have simply not been found yet, as most localities are in continental North America or Europe.. The upperparts are greyish-brown, with thin light fringes to the larger feathers and a maroon hindneck and cap (reaching just below the eye). The Christmas Shearwater often flies in a leisurely way like related Procellariidae, and thus can be mistaken for a petrel.\r\n	4375178840	2010-06-28 13:19:48
141	Bird Island numbers have been reduced 20% to 30% in the last 30 years. It seems to be convergent in some aspects with the punctatus superspecies. Silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey, respectively. Mesozoic bird phylogeny simplified after O Connor et al., 2013..\r\n	5225984555	2010-03-17 23:37:27
142	An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect s growth. Results from this study showed that an increase of hydrocarbon exploration resulted in a decreased success rate for breeding. During the breeding season, the petrels forage in waters surrounding Isla Alejandro Selkirk and Isla Robinson Crusoe, as well as coastal Chile. Scaled Quail made little or no use of sparse cholla-grassland, riparian areas, reseeded grasslands, or shortgrass prairie disclimax..\r\n	0963129580	2010-04-24 13:27:27
143	Alternatively  just as in the  turkey  bird (which is also from America), or the  guineafowl  (which are not limited to Guinea)   Muscovy  might be simply a generic term for a hard-to-reach and exotic place, in reference to the singular appearance of these birds. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. As it nears a month in age, the duckling s plumage will start becoming drab, looking more like the female (though its plumage is more streaked) and its legs will lose their dark grey colouring. They are then noisy birds, with a distinctive repetitive whiplash-like hwuit, hwuit call.\r\n	3658205264	2009-03-15 16:13:22
144	They are almost exclusively pelagic (feeding in the open ocean), and have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world s oceans, with the highest diversity being around New Zealand.. The egg tooth is so critical to a successful escape from the egg that chicks of most species will perish unhatched if they fail to develop one. By the third year, the young gulls resemble a streakier, dirtier-looking version of the adult. During migration the enormous flocks were a mile (1.6 km) wide, darkening the sky and 300 miles (480 km) long, taking several days to pass..\r\n	3704397724	2010-09-26 22:34:35
145	It has bare legs, with a sizable tarsus length of 10.3 to 11.2 cm (4.1 to 4.4 in). It is a rare but regular wanderer north of its breeding range.. It is absent from deserts and the Ro Balsas valley. At Chicago s North Pond in Lincoln Park..\r\n	3814383691	2009-10-21 16:40:45
146	Conflicts over territories, food and nest-defense have been reported with several other large species of raptor, such as the Great Horned (Bubo virginianus) and Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus), Hen Harrier (Circus cyaneus), Red-tailed and Swainson s Hawks (Buteo swainsonii), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), accipiters (Accipiter), ravens (Corvus), and magpies (Pica). Despite the proximity to the large winter numbers in Great Britain, only very small numbers occur in Ireland and France. Although Linnaeus included many Galliformes in his genus Phasianius  such as the domestic chicken and its wild ancestor the Red Junglefowl, nowadays Gallus gallus , today only the Common and the Green Pheasant are placed in this genus. Spiracles are located in the pleural area.\r\n	4376071914	2009-11-16 22:53:26
147	aeruginosus which is found across most of its range, and C. Adults have a glossy, greenish-black cap, a greenish back and wings that are grey-black grading into green or blue, a chestnut neck with a white line down the front, grey underparts and short yellow legs. Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Even more rarely there have been reports of herons eating acorns, peas and grains, but most vegetable matter consumed is accidental..\r\n	3569630639	2010-04-16 19:10:50
148	All these features enable Great Tinamou to be well-camouflaged in the rainforest understory.. Even sport hunting guides discouraged shooting these birds. It is the type species of the genus Cygnus. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, estrildid finches and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos.\r\n	2225119113	2010-11-15 15:20:28
149	They prefer to nest in tree cavities near water, but will use Wood Duck nesting boxes if available and unoccupied. It is a migrant, wintering at sea in the Atlantic Ocean and regularly reaching North American waters. The breeding male is a duller version of the female. Like other grouse, in the fall they grow  snow shoes  (short lateral extensions, or pectinations) on their toes.\r\n	9554741072	2010-03-14 17:36:37
150	Although nests are often reused for many years and herons are socially monogamous within a single breeding season, individuals usually choose new mates each year. After the breeding season, the flocks tend to be made up only of females and young.\r\n	3733257828	2010-08-20 16:31:15
151	hendersoni has a reddish belly and spotted flanks.. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly.\r\n	1796243167	2009-02-24 14:34:14
152	Some Golden Eagle pairs may not use a nest for up to six years after its construction. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as Wallcreeper and White-throated Dipper, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground.\r\n	2746316671	2009-06-21 11:23:20
153	The Mute Swan is found naturally mainly in temperate areas of Europe across western Asia, as far east as the Russian Maritimes, near Sidemi.. Extant birds have wings; the most recent species without wings was the moa, which is generally considered to have become extinct in the 16th century.\r\n	3000130420	2010-11-14 15:26:26
154	Two eggs are typically laid in a relatively small nest (usually made largely of leaves), each egg measuring 9.1 cm  6.7 cm (3.6 in  2.6 in) and weighing 200 g (7.1 oz). In Western Montana, nine distinct calls were noted: a chirp, a seeir, a pssa, a skonk, a cluck, a wonk, a honk and a hiss..\r\n	2174145270	2009-10-23 19:39:15
155	They alight on water with their feet retracted. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates.\r\n	1268238182	2009-07-25 21:39:21
156	This was also believed to be true for the sharp-tailed grouse. A breeding pair is formed in a courtship display.\r\n	4893106465	2010-04-28 20:15:44
157	Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the Snow Petrel s breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica. Controversially, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has permitted that a  wind-farmer  in central Oregon could legally cause the incidental killing of Golden Eagles by large wind turbines.\r\n	5168910213	2010-05-16 18:22:29
571	The breeding distribution of Swainson s Hawk is tied very closely to the distribution of various small mammals for this reason.\r\n	0862251636	2010-09-27 23:14:19
158	Among wild bovids, eagles are reportedly the main predator of Saiga Antelope (Saiga tatarica) calves in Mongolia and are regularly reported to take Chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and Alpine Ibex (Capra ibex) calves in Europe. Red foxes and coyotes readily predate colonies that they can access, the later being the only known species to hunt adult pelicans (which are too large for most bird predators to subdue).\r\n	6459202884	2010-03-22 13:31:47
159	The use of cormorants by Asian fishermen is in steep decline but survives in some areas as a tourist attraction.. Whooper Swans require large areas of water to live in, especially when they are still growing, because their body weight cannot be supported by their legs for extended periods of time.\r\n	3811029243	2010-08-19 11:57:57
160	The correct specific name for the Black-chested Eagle-buzzard when placed in Buteo, Buteo fuscescens, was reestablished in the mid-20th century for a short time more by accident than anything else; as most late-20th-century researchers argued for retaining Geranoaetus, this name was dismissed as erroneous and essentially forgotten.. Their diet includes green vegetation and grains.\r\n	3409417502	2009-03-19 16:26:57
161	Native Australians, however, differentiated the Sarus and the Brolga and called the Sarus  the crane that dips its head in blood . This area is crucial for the Falcated Duck due to its population being extremely low.\r\n	6313776667	2009-07-11 15:34:40
162	They mainly eat insects, mollusks, crustaceans and marine worms, but also eat some plant material.. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod dinosaurs had feathers, contribute to this ambiguity..\r\n	0466368904	2010-10-18 22:21:12
163	Hatching eggs should weigh at least 58g.. A few adult males were reported to weigh 1.753 kg (3.96.6 lbs), while females are about 14% larger on average..\r\n	9157643230	2009-09-21 22:32:11
164	However, some Trumpeter Swans have yellow lores; many of these individuals appear to be leucistic and have paler legs than typical Trumpeters. These birds feed while swimming, sometimes up-ending or dabbling to reach submerged food.\r\n	4007360581	2009-07-25 21:30:45
165	The lores of breeding Little Egrets are blue while those of the Reef Heron are reddish although some individuals of schistacea show blue and this is thought to be due to hybridization. This albatross has blackish-grey upperwing, mantle, back, upper rump, and tail, and its head, lower rump, and underparts are white.\r\n	0773425603	2010-09-11 22:50:18

167	The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.\r\n	4353532784	2010-03-17 12:43:19
168	The call is a loud croaking  fraaank . The Great Black-backed Gull is found in a variety of coastal habitats, including rocky and sandy coasts and estuaries, as well as inland wetland habitats, such as lakes, ponds, rivers, wet fields and moorland.\r\n	3417556354	2009-05-24 16:24:58
169	They themselves may fall prey to various hawks, owls and eagles, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by bears (Ursus spp.), various weasels (Mustela spp.), mink (Mustela vison), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and even Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus husonicus).. If an apparently empty nest has an owner the immature bird will abandon it without putting up a struggle when the owner arrives to claim the nest..\r\n	1495062789	2010-10-23 15:48:13

182	Drakes also engage in elaborate courtship behaviors, both on the water and in the air; it is not uncommon for a dozen or more males to pursue a single hen. It displaces the Yellow-headed Vultures from carcasses due to its larger size, but is displaced in turn by the King Vulture and both types of condor, which make the first cut into the skin of the dead animal.\r\n	7879708949	2009-03-26 12:57:46
183	The Actitis species have a distinctive stiff-winged flight low over the water.. There are several colour mutations of Indian Peafowl.\r\n	3374464874	2010-02-25 22:33:15
184	Their breeding habitat is marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. The bird is referenced in the old Hawaiian proverb ?A?ohe mea nana e ho?opuhili, he moho no ka la makani which means roughly  nothing can blow him off course, he is like a moho in the wind ; it was used to indicate admiration for an undaunted or determined person (as the bird was unable to fly, it was not affected by the wind).\r\n	8308637547	2010-06-18 15:10:23

187	The plumage of year-olds can be almost completely brown, in the second year the birds appearance changes depending on the different phases of moulting: they can have adult plumage at the front and continue to be brown at the rear. A few birds from the central Siberian range also winter in Iran at the south of the Caspian Sea; in former times these flocks also migrated to the Aral Sea before the late 20th century ecological catastrophe turned most of the habitat there into inhospitable wasteland.\r\n	5215036516	2009-08-21 16:53:33
188	Adults are quite vigorous at displacing potential predators from the nest site, with predator prevention usually falling to the larger male of the pair. About 95% of the Atlantic Puffins in North America breed around Newfoundland s coastlines..\r\n	6579840364	2010-01-13 15:45:30
189	Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the Black-footed Albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.. Newly hatched chicks are covered with down and are soon able to walk, swim, and feed themselves; however, they are not able to fly until 4045 days after hatching.\r\n	2725552297	2010-02-16 18:30:54
190	Its name refers to the Harpies of Ancient Greek mythology. Jeff Watson believed that Common Raven occasionally eats Golden Eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt.\r\n	7898449041	2010-02-27 16:30:11
191	Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.. The eclipse male is like the female, but darker on the back and head.\r\n	2476233856	2010-01-26 19:34:21
192	It can be distinguished from the Atlantic Yellow-nosed by its head, the grey plumage of which is lighter on the Indian Yellow-nosed.. Males are present around the nest for most of the day, and females most of the night.\r\n	1630058406	2009-01-13 18:15:47
193	It is found near water in forested parts of tropical northern and central South America, and far eastern Panama. In November, 2007, an oil spill in San Francisco harbour oiled and killed thousands of birds including many Surf Scoters.\r\n	3653399989	2009-07-24 19:29:46
194	During their mating season, the male birds announce their presence with the well known  cock-a-doodle-doo  call or crowing. Primarily, the largest number of Common Cranes are found breeding in wooded swamps, bogs and wetlands and seem to require quiet, peaceful environs with minimal human interference.\r\n	7369416348	2010-05-23 17:46:58
195	These weigh 3.47.8 kg (7.517.2 lb), 6.4 kg (14 lb) on average in males and 5.7 kg (13 lb) in females. (i.) coromandus, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, breeds in Asia and Australasia, and the western nominate form occupies the rest of the species range, including the Americas.\r\n	1428233819	2010-09-15 17:50:36
196	Some ornithologists have reported observing female herons attaching themselves to impotent mates, then seeking sexual gratification elsewhere.. Smaller cavities are preferred because of less competition with the larger Goldeneyes.\r\n	0118015911	2010-05-26 11:58:44

199	After hatching the chick is brooded for up to six days, until it is able to thermoregulate, after which it is left alone in the nest while both parents hunt for food. This heron is migratory in the northernmost part of its range, but otherwise resident (even in the cold Patagonia).\r\n	1799541550	2010-02-23 20:34:54
200	The wings are also relatively elongated, as the wing chord measures 3945 cm (1518 in). By holding one leg up against the ventral surface of the body, the flamingo lowers the surface area by which heat exits the body.\r\n	3880209669	2009-06-28 23:55:47
201	Among shorebirds, usually only larger types such as godwits, curlews, Tringa sp., stone-curlews and oystercatchers turn up as prey as smaller species are probably too flighty and agile to catch. Common predators of the Greater Scaup are owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans.\r\n	8766992611	2009-08-12 21:29:51
202	The IUCN Red List lists the species as Vulnerable due to its endemic status and threats from introduced predators.. Sunbitterns start nesting in the early wet season and before it start they make flight displays 1015 m high in the forest canopy.\r\n	4122957582	2010-10-18 12:37:44

205	The southern populations are sometimes considered a separate species, Cyrtonyx sallei. The sexes are similar, but the male averages slightly larger and the female has a duller crest.\r\n	4957550321	2010-10-20 10:23:53
206	The male s call is a rising whistle, jeeeeee; the females utter a drawn-out, rising squeal, do weep do weep, when flushed, and a sharp cr-r-ek, cr-e-ek for an alarm call.. The prosecuting attorney has estimated that the cost of raising and introducing to the wild one Whooping Crane could be as much as $100,000..\r\n	1931440490	2009-08-24 16:58:43
207	It is more similar to American Golden Plover, Pluvialis dominica, with which it was once considered conspecific (as  Lesser Golden Plover , see Sangster et al., 2002). Most of the rest of the body is white.\r\n	0399064790	2010-06-12 10:13:51

210	The tertials of flavirostris have indistinct pale fringes, whereas these pale fringes are more noticeable on albifrons. This duck s aggressive courting behaviour and willingness to interbreed with the endangered native White-headed Duck (Oxyura leucocephala), of southern Europe, has caused some concern.\r\n	4016083980	2009-07-13 15:46:38
211	It is found in Colombia and Ecuador. The remaining underparts are whitish.\r\n	9021038402	2010-04-14 22:27:29
212	However, no other naturalists record the Painted Vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting its validity began to be questioned, leading to what John Cassin described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology. A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water.\r\n	5115836730	2010-10-27 22:52:11
213	Around 20 days of age, the chicks generally start standing, which becomes the main position over the course of the next 40 days. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signaled a male s genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England.\r\n	1664403479	2010-09-13 21:41:30
214	They perform an elaborate display that includes wing fluttering, jumping, standing upright, crouching with ruff erect, or lunging at rivals. Two subspecies (which may actually be different species) have very different breeding habitats and ranges.\r\n	0867042173	2009-07-25 13:43:14
215	Adults have red eyes year-round, whereas Glossy Ibises have dark eyes. On average, birds begin breeding when they reach 8 to 15 years old, after which they breed biennially, fledging a chick every five years or so.\r\n	6311354335	2009-04-17 22:34:52
216	It is now commonly seen as far west as California. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects..\r\n	8549315341	2009-05-23 17:25:22
217	In winter plumage, they are duller and have more conspicuous barring on the wings, though this is still only visible at close range. In the 1890s, the term  peacocking  in Australia referred to the practice of buying up the best pieces of land ( picking the eyes ) so as to render the surrounding lands valueless.\r\n	4893827515	2010-05-16 18:46:57
218	It is sometimes semi-domestcated because of its useful function in controlling insects, and has benefited from the clearing of woodlands to create pasture..

224	The larger females take larger prey, with a minimum recorded prey weight of around 2.7 kg (6.0 lb). The legs are short and set well back on the body giving the bird its upright stance on land.\r\n	9863920107	2009-01-18 18:29:31
225	In Accipiter hawks (the most species-rich acciptrid genus), prey is mainly comprised by other birds. The carcass of a Muscovy Duck is also much heavier than most other domestic ducks, which makes it ideal for the dinner table..\r\n	2630839987	2010-02-27 13:41:35
226	In the period before migration, many birds display higher activity or Zugunruhe (German: migratory restlessness) as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. It primarily feeds on insects, especially in the breeding season, but it will consume plant material, including rice and maize, on migration and in winter.\r\n	3939669993	2009-07-22 12:12:13
227	It is sometimes cited as the largest eagle alongside the Philippine Eagle, that is somewhat longer on average and the Steller s Sea Eagle, that is slightly heavier on average. This bird is often the most numerous or only vulture present in primary lowland forests in its range, but in the Amazon rainforest it is typically outnumbered by the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture, while typically outnumbered by the Lesser Yellow-headed, Turkey and American Black Vulture in more open habitats.\r\n	7266806124	2009-08-26 15:49:40
228	The Japanese quail is considered to be a closely related allopatric species to the Common quail, though both are still recognized as distinct species. This genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and are now occasionally also included in Aquila, although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification.\r\n	1439338849	2009-11-19 17:19:29
229	They have a black crown and back with the remainder of the body white or grey, red eyes, and short yellow legs. This is unusual in a long-distance migrant.\r\n	6959590938	2009-10-16 15:30:46
230	Huyvaert and Parker (2010) detected low frequencies of inbreeding in Waved Albatrosses and genetic similarity was negatively related to EPFs, which is an unusual result that does not support the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. The breeding male (drake) is a striking bird with a mask of green feathers around its eyes and a cream colored cap running from the crown of its head to its bill.\r\n	8017905450	2009-11-24 18:59:32
231	Although Buffleheads do use man-made nest boxes, they still need the forest habitat to thrive.. The weakened egg eventually shatters under the pressure of the bird s movements.\r\n	9142481365	2009-08-18 10:15:58

234	One species, the Common Poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. One reason is because the Masked Boobies build very shallow flat nests, so older chicks can expel their younger siblings with relative ease.\r\n	1288075711	2010-09-25 13:12:26
235	Crops sometimes contain bulbs of plants that have no above-ground growth at that season; how the birds find such bulbs is unknown.. The females are polyandrous, and will help to defend the nests of up to four mates..\r\n	9071436725	2009-04-22 13:53:52
236	In the case of raptor nests, or eyries (also spelt aerie), these are often used for many years, with new material added each breeding season. In 59 studies of the breeding season diet across the range, 63.2% of prey remains were of mammals.\r\n	0921189783	2010-02-18 22:12:22
237	Nests in Scotland may found at anywhere from 10 to 65 pairs per 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi), with an average of over 20 pairs found per area. At the close of the breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult.\r\n	7600035385	2009-03-20 14:40:53

245	The eyes are partly encircled with thin post-orbital crescents of very short grey feathers. One pair of Golden Eagles killed but did not eat 3 Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), implying that they were killed in nest defense and not in predation.\r\n	0118368796	2009-12-10 20:31:21
246	It was for a long time misspelt mutus, in the erroneous belief that the ending of Lagopus denotes masculine gender. The bill of flavirostris is orange-yellow with a dark nail, compared with the bright pink bill of albifrons which has only a hint of dark on the nail; in addition the bill of flavirostris is longer and appears slimmer than that of albifrons.\r\n	2626650988	2009-05-23 14:28:41

306	These birds feed by dabbling or walking on land. The population at Atrato valley, Colombia, would probably be the most threatened caused by human settlement, and conversion to farmland and banana plantations. Despite its superficial similarity to the Brent Goose, genetic analysis has shown it is an eastern derivative of the Cackling Goose lineage.. The Great Blue Heron is replaced in the Old World by the very similar Grey Heron (  Ardea cinerea), which differs in being somewhat smaller (9098 cm (3539 in)), with a pale gray neck and legs, lacking the browner colors that Great Blue Heron has there.\r\n	0755534711	2010-05-27 11:25:27

312	Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. The spread of parasites such as the nematode Echinuria uncinata could be extremely pathogenic, as well as the introduction of disease by migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway (such as avian influenza, avian malaria, cholera, botulism and duck plague). When nesting starts, the males aggregate while they moult into eclipse plumage, leaving the task of incubation and raising the young to the females alone.. The species may also be present in southern Mexico.\r\n	9977751206	2009-12-25 23:50:39
313	These birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) of Washington State has created aquatic reserves surrounding Smith and Minor Islands. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird s breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.. White Little Blue Herons often mingle with Snowy Egrets.\r\n	6076695993	2009-01-24 15:12:58
314	Calls are sometimes distinctive enough for individual identification even by human researchers in ecological studies.. It migrates mainly by day, often in large flocks. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. They have white spots on their head and on their back and a v-shaped white area underneath.\r\n	5839753802	2009-08-25 17:47:45
315	They use their highly specialized bill (from which their name is derived) to forage for aquatic invertebrates  a carnivorous diet. In flight, the flight feathers are blackish with a strong white wing bar. Pairs that nest later in the season have a lower chance of raising chicks successfully, but this improves when territories have more wetlands. Their most distinctive feature and namesake are the yellow tufts (Latin: cirri) that appear annually on birds of both sexes as the summer reproductive season approaches.\r\n	1395210849	2009-09-27 11:13:43
316	The family has forty-one species in 14 genera. The nesting season is January through June in Florida and is possibly similar in the tropics. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel.\r\n	0028351205	2009-08-13 12:22:13
317	It can dive as deep as 100 ft (30 m) to feed on or near the seafloor. In Blue-footed and Red-footed Boobies, parading also includes lifting and flaunting their brightly colored feet at their prospective partner.. Manx Shearwaters have nested along the Atlantic coast of northeastern North America since the 1970s and have expanded their breeding range southward into the Gulf of Maine, with a pair confirmed as nesting at Matinicus Rock. The Highland Tinamou is a shy Tinamou and usually solitary or in small groups of up to five.\r\n	5341511116	2010-04-14 13:58:39

When approached from below their level, they attempt to climb up the slopes on foot and when approached from above the dive down the valleys on open wings. digital photography method effectively and efficiently.. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions.\r\n	2073891353	2009-11-18 11:23:48
321	The White-faced Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna viduata) is a whistling duck that breeds in sub-Saharan Africa and much of South America.. They do not have white under their wings when flying, like other grebes. The body length averages about 132 cm (52 in). High perching occurs from prominent places around the nest, particularly early in the breeding cycle.\r\n	9087977974	2009-02-22 11:39:22
322	The most important wintering area is the Baltic Sea, where a total of about 4.5 million gather.. Some predators take advantage of the concentration of birds during migration. The Magnificent Frigatebird is 100 cm (39 in) long with a 215 cm (85 in) wingspan. There is at least one case in Scotland of a Golden Eagle dying after being oiled by a Northern Fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibits the predator s ability to fly.\r\n	6904125021	2009-01-12 20:45:25
323	Young birds are known to disperse up to 5,000 km (3,100 mi) from their breeding area. Their call is a high-pitched squeak, sounding similar to that of a squeaky dog toy.. This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one. The female has a brown body, with a white underside and a light brown crest extending from the back of the head.\r\n	0295399902	2010-07-19 16:47:31
324	Outside the breeding season the Chinese Egret occurs in shallow tidal estuaries, mudflats and bays, occasionally visiting rice-fields and fish ponds. There is an all-white morph and a dark grey morph; morphs can also occur with intermediate shades of grey which may be related to age or particoloured in grey and white. This is a typical harrier, which hunts long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight during which the bird closely hugs the contours of the land below them. The causes for this stark  though not threatening yet  decline remain unknown.\r\n	9700999694	2010-03-14 18:45:51

325	The wild Mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.. The main prey species in most of this sizeable area is the largest species of grouse, the Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), supplemented by its cousins, the Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the Hazel Grouse (Tetrastes bonasia). Northern gannets also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water.. The female grabs food from the male s talons with hers while flipping upside-down.\r\n	8876666172	2010-11-13 19:47:36
326	A smaller mean cellular volume recorded in free living flamingos coupled with similar mean hemoglobin content between captive and free living flamingos could show different oxygen diffusion characteristics between these two groups. From early spring until after breeding has finished in mid-late summer, the breast feathers have a yellowish hue. They feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but roost in trees at night. These birds feed by dabbling in shallow water, and grazing on land.\r\n	7862717888	2010-11-27 20:58:20
327	There are indications that the breeding success is decreasing, but why this is so remains puzzling. Flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes). In December 1996, a Canvasback was observed in a quarry in Kent, which was followed by an additional sighting in Norfolk in January 1997. The males display in courtship by raising the upper-tail coverts into an arched fan.\r\n	9122786502	2010-02-26 22:50:28
328	Chicks increase in size to 560 g (larger than the adults) then drop to around 430 g before fledging. Their fat reserves allow them to pass two or three weeks without eating. The breeding pair builds a stick nest (also sometimes including shredded bark, leaves and green sprigs) in a major fork of a large tree. Cuckoos and allies (Cuculiformes).\r\n	4329337518	2010-11-10 18:30:47
329	They also make a rising, shrill piping call.. The Black-footed Albatross, like the rest of its family, forms long term pair-bonds that last for life. In a study that was conducted, there were tested two hypotheses that could explain mitochondrial paraphyly of Holarctic gadwalls (Anas strepera) with respect to Asian falcated ducks (A. It drinks by skimming the surface and collecting water in its beak..\r\n	3043944576	2009-11-21 12:55:23
330	It is rare but increasing in Great Britain where it has spread as far as eastern Scotland. It has a black smudge around the eye, and its underwing pattern varies between individuals, with some having narrower black margins and variable amounts of black in the underwing coverts. The fossil records of boobies are not as well documented as those of the gannets; possibly because the species of boobies were less numerous in the late Miocene to Pliocene, when gannets had their highest diversity or because of the more tropical distribution of boobies, many fossil species have simply not been found yet, as most localities are in continental North America or Europe.. Researchers have analysed calls of Blue-footed Boobies and conducted playback experiments.\r\n	1097937844	2010-08-16 14:11:41
331	King Vultures generally do not live above 1500 m (5000 ft), although are found in places at 2500 m (8000 ft) altitude east of the Andes, and have been rarely recorded up to 3300 m (10000 ft) They inhabit the emergent forest level, or above the canopy. It rarely swims or flies unless hard pressed. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Still, it is just as possible that - given the fairly common instances of hybridization in calidrines - mitochondrial DNA data has given a false picture of this species  true affinities.\r\n	2861014755	2010-10-23 22:59:23
332	The smallest bird nests are those of some hummingbirds, tiny cups which can be a mere 2 cm (0.79 in) across and 23 cm (0.791.18 in) high. Adult feeding a nestling in Apenheul zoo. Red gape color has been shown in several experiments to induce feeding. A few parasitic species are pathogenic.\r\n	4768928166	2010-10-15 11:25:13
333	The population is thought to number 1,000-2,499 individuals, based on an estimate of 1,000 in late 1970s and more recent information that some areas such as El Triunfo may be secure and hold relatively high densities. Males of the larger gull species have bigger, stouter beaks than those of females of the same species, and immatures can have smaller, more slender beaks than those of adults. Alimentary canal of the bird exposed.. There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes.\r\n	5668504725	2010-05-24 14:13:38
334	The eggs are pale blue and speckled, about 4.7  3.6 cm, and the normal clutch is three or four. Before the start of the population decline (see below), about 57% of the Lesser Scaup nests failed each breeding season because the female was killed or the eggs were eaten or destroyed. The birds are of at least the subspecies hutchinsii, and possibly others. The climate of the breeding area is important, and few species can cope with the harsh winters of inland Canada or northern Eurasia.\r\n	8839372911	2009-04-27 18:42:37
335	These relationships last until a male or female is replaced. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits. A mud nest is built in bare rocky areas or in tussock grass or ferns, and a single egg is laid. ! is indicates that there has been a signifi cant population expansion during their.\r\n	8564606175	2010-07-21 16:51:58
336	Birds in the north and south of the breeding range, including the populations in Central America, Trinidad, northern Venezuela and Colombia, and southern Argentina and Brazil, are migratory, moving into tropical South America in the northern winter.. The Golden Eagle is the only major avian predator of adult turkeys. But the main nesting season may start before the onset of the rainy season as the nesting attempt was abandoned when heavy rains recommenced. Breeding maturity is not reached until birds are 4 to 6 years of age.\r\n	2812179697	2009-08-24 20:32:58
337	The Gunnison Grouse (Centrocercus minimus) is a species of grouse endemic to the United States. Bird song is an integral part of bird courtship and is a pre-zygotic isolation mechanism involved in the process of speciation. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down.

354	Adult birds are sometimes caught and eaten by the homeless.. Leporids are basically solitary animals but they can occur at high densities, such as when jackrabbits are at their peak numbers in brushy areas of Western North America or (historically at least) rabbits in similar brush habitats on the Iberian peninsula. Trees are used by many species, and here they may be placed high up from the ground, whereas species living in reedbeds may nest very close to the ground..\r\n	3371649712	2009-07-19 17:26:46
339	The spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae. Common Pheasants are native to Asia, their original range extending from between the Black and Caspian Seas to Manchuria, Siberia, Korea, Mainland China and Taiwan. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Their closest relative is Gambel s Quail which has a more southerly distribution and, a longer crest (2.5 in (6.4 cm)), a brighter head and a scalier appearance.\r\n	6459754447	2010-02-25 15:59:48

341	Here, the Golden Eagle flies over a herd of ungulates which in turn often huddle or break into run. In the breeding season, they tend to be territorial and are aggressive to many animals who pass by; outside the breeding season they are rather gregarious birds.. After breeding these birds migrate south to Africa, Australasia or India. The development of the Robel pole and cover boards has become a key tool in habitat assessment providing land managers a means to inventory and study habitat preferences based on vegetation structure and density.\r\n	4926014225	2010-04-14 20:56:56

343	Pesticide containers and oil spills have contaminated Laysan in the past. They also are fairly successful utilizing cleared forests and plantations or farmed land. It was reassigned to the genus Sarcoramphus in 1805 by French zoologist Andr Marie Constant Dumril. They may even spend the winter on lakes in parks, as long as they are not harassed, and will occur even on smallish Caribbean islands such as Grand Cayman.\r\n	2439919393	2009-08-23 18:23:51
344	Eggs are generally laid in the nesting site in a protected location such as a cliff, a cave, a rock crevice, a burrow, inside a hollow tree, or in a thicket. The greater-coverts of flavirostris are dark grey, with a narrow white tip, forming a narrow wing-bar; on albifrons they are blue-grey, with prominent white tips, forming a bold wing-bar. Taxonomists are often referred to as  lumpers  or  splitters  by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognizing differences or commonalities between organisms (see lumpers and splitters)..

Poor weather can lead to high mortality rates among eggs and chicks and they are also preyed on by skuas and sheathbills.\r\n	0881572700	2010-08-15 21:29:33
346	Its breeding distribution is in wetlands in warm temperate to tropical parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Males are polygamous in the sexually dimorphic species, but monogamous in at least some of the monomorphic species. The Red-legged species, along with the Rock Partridge (Alectoris graeca) and Grey Partridge (Perdix perdix), are the leading prey group in the French Pyrenees at 15.8% of a sampling of 114 from 10 nests. In recent years, the first birds were seen in early November, and some stayed til late February.\r\n	3312042684	2010-09-27 21:27:56
347	The endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longerup to two yearsto excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse it for more than two decades. The chicks are precocial and soon leave the nest and while they are young, both parents play a part in caring for them. The demand was so great that Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children s magazine Puffin Post was established. The pilot brought the plane to an emergency  splash -landing in the Hudson River, causing only minor injuries..\r\n	0167302090	2009-10-26 12:37:48
348	In one instance in Norway, a pair of Golden Eagles harassed a newly formed pair of White-tailed Eagles so persistently that the White-tails abandoned their nesting attempt. In the Pacific Ocean it breeds on Islas Ildefonso, Diego De Almagro, Islas Evangelistas, Campbell Island, Antipodes Islands, Snares Islands, and Macquarie Island. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to make their way to the sea but sometimes get confused, perhaps by the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village.\r\n	5739432915	2009-03-15 11:58:55
349	The Osprey and owls are the only raptors whose outer toe is reversible, allowing them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. The plight of this bird inspired the novel (and subsequent Emmy Award winning 1972 ABC Afterschool Special) Last of the Curlews.. The largest member of the grouse family is the Eurasian Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), at up to 6.7 kg (15 lb) and 1 m (3 ft).

The northern regions experience a steady decline in Blue-winged Teal populations from early September until early November. It is absorbed through the walls of the gut and into the extracellular fluid.\r\n	7836326510	2009-11-13 19:55:17
353	He concluded that the savannah style habitat was the habitat needed for best management. The Australian race has a distinctively darker plumage and a larger grey patch of ear coverts.[note 1] This population shows the most recent divergence from the ancestral form with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within Australia. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is arguably the richest biosphere the Golden Eagle is known to inhabit and there, this species may potentially interact with more than 10 other eagle species and nearly 30 other accipitrid species, including both migratory and resident breeding species.\r\n	4154292488	2009-03-22 16:17:12

356	The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a  Queen Eider ) is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure. They are 1723 cm long, but the females are larger than the males. The tail is fairly long, measuring 34 to 43 cm (13 to 17 in) in length.\r\n	7241484754	2009-09-26 23:34:14
357	The probably-extinct Jamaica Petrel (P. The Zone-tailed Hawk adults resemble the Common Black Hawk but are distinctly more slender in flight and overall small, and they have more white bars on the tail. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.\r\n	3815365001	2009-10-15 19:34:18
358	During the last ice age, the species was far more widespread in continental Europe.. An attempted capture of a Great Blue Heron by a Golden Eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There are an estimated 1.32.0 million breeding pairs in Europe, three-quarters of which are in European Russia, and a further 515,0001,240,000 pairs in Asiatic Russia; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5.45 and 9.72 million individuals.\r\n	7884324644	2010-04-18 17:32:17
359	The breeding behaviour of the Long-billed Murrelet is very unusual. They overwinter in the southern United States near the Atlantic coast. Mortality in adults is quite low, usually being 80100% annually, unless they are hunted by humans.\r\n	4245266505	2009-06-12 15:48:28
360	Sibley and Ahlquist s Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Major threats to the well-being of this species start with the typical accidental deaths caused by longline fishing as well as trawl fishing near the Falkland Islands. It is white below, unlike other north Atlantic petrels, and has a white face with a black eye mask like a phalarope.\r\n	8979373537	2010-05-18 17:20:31

362	As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.. At any rate, American Black Ducks and local Mallards are now very hard to distinguish by means of microsatellite comparisons, even if many specimens are sampled  Contrary to this study s claims, the question whether the American haplotypes are an original Mallard lineage is far from resolved. Procellariiformes is an order of seabirds that comprises four families: the albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, storm petrels, and diving petrels.\r\n	9211158343	2009-08-15 16:55:40
363	However, in each case, such gathering is not social, but motivated by good feeding or migrating conditions.. The initial flight for the males is taken at 38 to 40 days while the slower-developing females fly about 10 days later. This species nests on the ground, laying three or four eggs.\r\n	4756837817	2010-07-18 18:52:49
364	Many tropical regions have wet and dry seasons, inducing some birds to migrate or wander widely to find food. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. When birds are raised in isolation, away from the influence of conspecific males, they still sing.\r\n	2912605072	2010-02-25 11:16:43
365	Until 2010, despite a breeding range estimated at 12,400,000 km2 (4,800,000 mi2), the Corn Crake was classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased.

369	It is the most abundant duck in the mixed-grass prairies of the Dakotas and the prairie provinces of Canada. Such behavior may be accompanied by wing slap against the threatening intruder. The eggs are laid at daily intervals, but second clutches may sometimes have two eggs added per day.\r\n	6204904387	2009-09-16 15:14:18
370	These changes are also related to hormonal changes in the birds.. After the last egg has been laid, both parents incubate for about 1921 days until hatching, and feed the young birds. It is typically 3338 cm (1315 in) long and weighs 190-280g (6.7-10 oz).\r\n	2969583212	2009-05-15 14:59:19
371	The Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in wetlands over most of North America and Central America as well as the Caribbean and the Galpagos Islands. They nest on beaches on coastal islands and feed on marine invertebrates. The value of this insect control has been estimated.\r\n	2507663800	2010-06-11 19:39:17
372	In Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, Belarus and almost the entire distribution in Russia all the way to the Pacific Ocean, Golden Eagles occur sparsely in lowland taiga forest. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal because its beak is not strong enough to tear into the tough hide. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it will signal to the rest of the group and they will all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like arrows..\r\n	3442340231	2010-03-19 13:57:43
373	All these races are similar in plumage, differing only in size.. When nesting starts, the males aggregate while they moult into eclipse plumage, leaving the task of incubation and raising the young to the females alone.. Due to the amount of variability in different individuals, juvenile eagles cannot be reliably aged on sight alone.\r\n	3073105837	2009-05-19 19:15:36
374	Birds forage much closer to the Hauraki Gulf over the summer and autumn while incubating an egg and raising a chick  mainly in the Tasman Sea and to the North East of NZ (Bell et al.

375	They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae. The White-winged Dove of southwestern North America was known to nest in large colonies when foraging areas could support such numbers. And while molecular analyses and biogeography indicate that most species of the mallard group in the genus Anas form two distinct clades, hybridization between all of these species is a regularly occurring phenomenon and the hybrids are usually fully fertile.\r\n	3419847619	2010-08-24 23:48:32
376	The species practices asynchronous hatching, which means that eggs that are laid first are hatched before the consequent eggs, resulting in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings. Between 2,000 and 4,000 were killed in 19971998 due to illegal longline fishing. Unlike in their relationship with smaller raptors, Golden Eagles are rarely reported to hunt other eagle species.\r\n	8832978637	2009-05-12 13:22:44
377	The non-territorial female does not normally show evidence of its genetic type, but when females are given testosterone implants, they display the male territorial behaviour corresponding to their genotype.. Because a large part of its small population nests in such a small area a single catastrophic oil spill could have far reaching implications. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability.\r\n	6847739101	2010-08-28 22:36:47
378	Fulda, Minnesota has adopted the Wood Duck as an unofficial mascot, and a large number of nest boxes can be found in the area.. sandwichensis, found near Kailua-Kona.. The contribution of ungulates to the diet of Golden Eagles has long been the most controversial and debated aspect of the species whole biology.\r\n	0614418718	2010-05-27 20:22:16
379	The IUCN classifies this bird as vulnerable due to rapidly declining numbers. These birds produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. Several other studies have looked at seasonal changes in the morphology of brain structures within the song system and have found that these changes (adult neurogenesis, gene expression) are dictated by photoperiod, hormonal changes and behavior..\r\n	6201925449	2009-04-17 12:58:13
380	The body is dark grey-brown on top and white underneath. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. They are typically seen in flocks, small in the wet season, up to 100 in the dry season.\r\n	4956543629	2009-09-10 15:38:15
381	The standard measurements are as follows: the bill is 5.4 to 7.25 cm (2.13 to 2.85 in), the wing chord is 44.5 to 53 cm (17.5 to 20.9 in) and the tarsus is 6.6 to 8.8 cm (2.6 to 3.5 in).. between the CascadeSierra Nevada and Rocky. Declines in the numbers of many Neotropical migratory bird species have been detected over the past several decades.\r\n	7833420907	2010-02-21 18:51:40
382	It is extinct or threatened in many locations due to habitat loss. When courting they will spread their wings, wave their heads, and rap their bills together, while braying. It has also earned them nicknames like  hell-diver.  They rarely spend time in flocks.\r\n	4327705506	2010-03-22 20:18:36
383	Incubation averages 30 days, and nest success is high (79% in one study) compared to ground-nesting species like the Teal. They may even spend the winter on lakes in parks, as long as they are not harassed, and will occur even on smallish Caribbean islands such as Grand Cayman. Immature insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called nymphs or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies, naiads.\r\n	0379860478	2009-11-23 17:51:38
384	Common terms in English include words such as quack, chirp and chirrup. In smaller streams, they are present in pairs or smaller groups, and they float down, twisting round and round in the rapids, or fishing vigorously in some deep pool near the foot of some waterfall or rapid. Like all albatrosses, the Laysan Albatross is known to be a long-living bird.\r\n	8096591089	2010-05-17 20:55:55
385	The Emperor Penguin is one of the heaviest living birds as well as the largest penguin.. The term teetar can also refer to other partridges and quails. In mild climates from California to the Great Lakes, some of the population has become non-migratory due to adequate winter food supply and a lack of former predators..\r\n	5669589324	2010-02-23 12:23:32
386	The Crab Plover also uses a burrow nest, the warmth of which allows it to leave the eggs unattended for as long as 58 hours.. The Common Sandpiper breeds across most of temperate and subtropical Europe and Asia, and migrates to Africa, southern Asia and Australia in winter. It winters further south in temperate zones, on the Great Lakes, the coasts of the northern USA and the southern coasts of Canada, and Asia as far south as China.\r\n	6485295665	2010-07-24 15:56:20
387	A monogamous species, the Great Curassow is distributed in rainforest from eastern Mexico throughout Central America, to western Colombia and northwest Ecuador. Lesser Scaup females show the characteristic darker iris (bright yellow in Greater Scaup males and females) at closer distances. All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also Ratites.\r\n	2084409047	2010-12-26 15:14:35
388	It belongs in the group of large species that could be separated as genus Ardenna (Penhallurick & Wink 2004); within these, it might be allied with the other black-billed, blunt-tailed species Short-tailed Shearwater and especially Sooty Shearwater (Austin 1996, Heidrich et al. cristatus averaging 1.25 kg (2.8 lb). The Corn Crake is a medium-sized rail, 2730 cm (10.611.8 in) long with a wingspan of 4253 cm (16.520.9 in).\r\n	4995489038	2010-06-22 16:25:47
389	Week-old chicks are fed about 15 times per day, and they grow rapidly. In other words, the bird becomes  deaf  to his own song. The populations west of the Taimyr Peninsula migrate via the White Sea, Baltic Sea and the Elbe estuary to winter in Denmark, the Netherlands and the British Isles.\r\n	0803913135	2010-08-27 19:43:32
390	Growth is relatively rapid and the incubation period is about 28 to 30 days. They are monogamous and often reuse the same nest each year, restoring or rebuilding it as needed. On the main wintering grounds in West Africa, rice is a favoured food during the later part of the season as the ricefields dry out..\r\n	6253282289	2010-06-13 14:15:53
391	In tropical areas, cavities are sometimes excavated in arboreal insect nests. They overlap greatly in breeding and feeding range with the other two species of northern albatross, although the other two will range further north into the Bering Sea than the Black-footed will. It is a rare vagrant to Europe, with records from Spain, the Azores, England and the Netherlands.\r\n	4652880386	2010-08-26 13:33:32
392	The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where  dances  are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males  breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.. It has a spiky crest and long thin red bill with serrated edges. It is given from the ground, whereas other quails sing on such perches as the tops of fenceposts or bushes.\r\n	0109995099	2009-05-21 11:53:37
393	Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male. The migration to the winter quarters starts in September; by late October, the birds are absent from regions where they do not stay all year. Salinity plays a role in the growth and development of goslings.\r\n	8665583009	2010-02-24 11:50:51
394	Breeding takes place from October to June in the Hauraki Gulf. The Black Oystercatcher is a large entirely black shorebird, with a long (9 cm) bright red bill and pink legs. Raccoons are the leading predator of nests, and can cause almost complete colony nesting failure when water dries under nests in drought years since they can easily access the nest using dry ground under the tree.\r\n	0234138401	2010-02-15 22:53:59
395	SE Turkestan around the Tarim Basin.. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds.. This latter group is certainly not a natural one, and even after the tropicbirds have been recognised as quite distinct, the remaining Pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely monophyletic.\r\n	0865991828	2009-08-21 12:51:23
396	At other times of year, leftover grains and other crops such as potatoes, picked up in open fields after harvest, make up much of their diet. Zone-tailed Hawks can adapt to various habitats across their broad range, including both closed and open ones and wet and dry ones. The study of fossilized insects is called paleoentomology..\r\n	4500557121	2009-10-15 19:47:13
397	It was described from the bones of three individuals snared in fishing nets in the late 1950s at Constantine Harbor on Amchitka in the Aleutian Islands. It is important to note, however, that this may simply be that the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and maximize parental reproductive output. In North America, there are both feral domestic geese, which are similar to greylags, and occasional vagrants..\r\n	8555884500	2010-06-15 12:22:43
398	If they live in an area where the water freezes in the winter they will migrate. Many birds die, and others, while attempting to remove the oil by preening, ingest and inhale toxins. The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed.\r\n	9464112552	2010-12-22 16:56:26
399	Its diet consists mainly of seeds, leaves and berries.. The female lays from 29 eggs with an average of five and both parents protect the nest while the eggs incubate, but the female spends more time at the nest than the male.. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility.\r\n	3917669533	2009-09-26 12:51:59

401	On the 7th of February 2004, 2.5 million Oriental Pratincoles were recorded on Eighty Mile Beach in Australia s north-west by the Australasian Wader Studies Group. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. Bits and pieces of greenery are often added to the nest.\r\n	7807362647	2010-10-23 17:17:15
402	In the Snake River canyon in Idaho, nests are 5 to 8 km (3.1 to 5.0 mi) apart, while two other nearby studies in Idaho found the average distance were 4.3 km (2.7 mi) and 4.39 km (2.73 mi), respectively. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Adults are about 19 inches (480 mm) in length..\r\n	9443649285	2010-03-20 16:54:43
403	These can often be found by looking for the feathers of the bird on the ground and on twigs at the edges of its trail. Both parents care for the young, who are able to fly in less than a month.. The bill is relatively long (about twice the length of the head), sharply pointed and yellow as are the webbed feet..\r\n	6716494182	2009-02-22 20:15:43
404	Eggs hatch after 1622 days, and the young leave the nest at between 16 and 30 days of age.. Congress passed the Endangered Species Preservation Act in 1966, and in 1967 the Laysan Duck was declared an endangered species with federal protection. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay..\r\n	7064717027	2010-07-17 15:48:56
405	The chicks are fed by the parents for the first few days, but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food. After about one week of courtship and nest-building, the female lays a clutch of usually 2 or 3 eggs, sometimes just 1, sometimes up to 6.. It usually lays two glossy dark purple coloured eggs, sometimes only one.\r\n	6304601446	2009-04-28 22:32:54
406	Their most unusual feature of the pratincoles is that although classed as waders they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.. They are also found in southern Texas, on the Baja California peninsula, and in eastern Mexico, and on a global scale they are not considered threatened species by the IUCN. The timing of breeding activity varies depending on location: November to December in western Mexico, March to June in Costa Rica, January in Venezuela, and March in the lowlands of Ecuador.\r\n	4573024320	2010-11-27 15:11:32
407	Its strong toes are padded and have reduced webbing, an adaptation that allows it to swiftly traverse rough terrain such as lava plains.. As the burrowing animal reaches the surface, the hawk rises into the air and pounces upon it even while it is still underneath the loose earth.. Other countries and dependencies which have depicted Atlantic Puffins on their stamps include Alderney, Canada, the Faroe Islands, France, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, St Pierre et Miquelon and the United Kingdom.\r\n	5076277033	2009-03-13 20:16:16
408	 Giant  is a relative term among the hummingbirds, the smallest-bodied variety of birds, and this species weighs up to 24 g (0.85 oz) at a length of 23 cm (9.1 in).. They appear to be more closely associated to water than chukars are, and in drier areas.. It is possible for up to 30 to 50 foxes to be caught by a single eagle during this season.\r\n	0389811146	2009-03-25 12:50:14
409	In one instance, during an act of attempted predation by a Golden Eagle, a heron was able to mortally wound the eagle although itself succumbed to injures sustained in the fight. The Lesser Scaup drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. Although this is a species of least concern, it is slowly declining due to habitat destruction.\r\n	8334291535	2009-05-23 12:46:54
410	This area has large populations of bivalves in the underlying sediments at depths of about 60 m that the ducks dive to feed on.. anhinga subspecies is larger than A. They may also stand still and wait to ambush prey..\r\n	7444668378	2009-04-19 19:26:29
411	Even more rarely, they may predate on lizards, frogs, or snakes. These birds migrate south (mostly via the Central and Mississippi Flyways) when the young are fledged and return in early spring, usually arriving on the breeding ground in May. In raptors, the cere is a sexual signal which indicates the  quality  of a bird; the orangeness of a Montague s Harrier s cere, for example, correlates to its body mass and physical condition.\r\n	2525969883	2009-08-27 21:55:18
412	There are two subspecies although one is extinct:. The breeding season is summer, April to June. The wings may be used to frighten prey (or possibly attract it to shade) or to reduce glare; the most extreme example of this is exhibited by the Black Heron, which forms a full canopy with its wings over its body..\r\n	5824268980	2009-10-12 19:42:26
578	The male fetches sticks of the nest while the female places them to form the platform.\r\n	0903788623	2009-09-18 16:45:48
413	Great Tinamou are approximately 44 cm (17 in) long, 1.1 kg (2.4 lb) in weight and size and shape of a small turkey. Some Bar-tailed Godwits have the longest known non-stop flight of any migrant, flying 11,000 km from Alaska to their New Zealand non-breeding areas. The same study found that the Macgregor s Bird-of-paradise was actually a member of the large Australasian honeyeater family.\r\n	8848639326	2009-04-13 22:31:23
414	Greater Scaup are rated as a species of least concern by the IUCN Redlist. It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers, possibly to protect the digestive system. Dancing may also be a displacement activity when the nest or young are threatened.\r\n	6818952200	2009-11-17 21:47:47
415	In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. The most important single breeding site, at jrsrver in Iceland (holding 10,700 pairs in 1970), was only discovered in 1951, by Sir Peter Scott and his team who made an expedition to seek the breeding grounds. It catches fish by holding its bill open in the water until a fish is detected..\r\n	6042066496	2009-04-28 22:45:52
416	At about 22 cm (8.75 in), it is one of the shortest quails of North America, although it weighs 180 g (6 oz), the same as some Callipepla quails that are several centimetres longer. The typical adult has blackish upperparts and crown, bright chestnut sides to the neck and breast and a black-edged white throat and central breast. But his anas indica (based, like Gessner s brief discussion, ultimately on the reports of Christopher Columbus s travels) also seems to have included another species, perhaps a whistling-duck (Dendrocygna).\r\n	8487675933	2009-03-22 23:50:50
417	Their ritual displays are also a form of communication.. Some temperate region insects are capable of activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go into a state of torpor. The Providence Petrel (Pterodroma solandri) is a species that burrows in one location; isolated Lord Howe Island, some 800 km from the Australian mainland in the Tasman Sea..\r\n	5147241750	2009-06-16 12:53:46
418	Today, its range is restricted to Hawai?i, Maui, Moloka?i, and Kaua?i. A female jacana lives in a territory that encompasses the territories of 1-4 males. They mainly eat plants, but also some mollusks and aquatic insects.\r\n	5338407488	2010-09-22 18:14:47
419	In Central Utah, 57% of eggs successfully hatched out of 87 eggs from 44 clutches. In such cases they will head for the nearest location offering food and cover. When this is about to take place the brooding bird will release the egg from its webbed feet to prevent the egg from breaking under the adults weight as the chick breaks it open.\r\n	1910545513	2010-01-15 18:27:36
420	depredation should be aware of the potential. This spot triggers begging behavior in gull chicks. The American Ornithologists  Union stated that  political correctness  was not sufficient to change the name, but  to conform with English usage in other parts of the world , it officially adopted the name Long-tailed Duck..\r\n	2638883598	2009-09-15 22:47:54
421	This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one. a few years, it has produced remarkable results.. The birds are found in woodland, farmland, scrub, and wetlands.\r\n	9785163523	2009-10-18 11:55:15
422	Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site. They face each other and then turn their heads and bills up.\r\n	7358929400	2009-11-12 17:41:55
423	It spends days and nights on the wing, with an average ground speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph), covering up to 223 km (139 mi) before landing. The Turkey Vulture does not kill live animals but will mix with flocks of Black Vultures and will scavenge what they leave behind. The importance of the bird being able to hear itself sing in the sensorimotor period was later discovered by Konishi.\r\n	4826476958	2010-06-18 21:24:50
424	They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down. A Cattle Egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. The primaries, the tips of secondaries, the alula, the tip of the tail, and the edges of upper tail coverts are all black and the greater coverts droop into explosive plumes.\r\n	8892532566	2010-10-17 22:21:32
425	The Golden Eagles appear to vigorously defend their territories from the Verreaux s Eagles and, as in its relationship with the Bonelli s, the two species appear to maintain exclusive territories. The Blue-footed Booby is one of only two species of Booby that raises more than one chick in a breeding cycle.. Wind turbine blades appear to move slowly from a distance but at close range move so quickly as to appear a nearly invisible blur.\r\n	2681253049	2009-08-11 18:40:54
426	The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.. Chemical repellents may prove necessary. In their non-breeding habitat they feed on intertidal mudflats and along the muddy margins of freshwater lakes.\r\n	7740232397	2009-12-10 23:58:26
427	The adult male is glossy greenish black on the back and crown; the adult female is glossy brown on these parts. There is post-breeding dispersal to well north of the nesting range, as far as the CanadaUnited States border.. To dry their feathers after diving, darters move to a safe location and spread their wings..\r\n	6410200270	2009-11-26 18:45:28
428	In species where there is polygyny and with considerable sexual dimorphism, there is a tendency for males to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females. The Eastern or Chinese Spot-billed Duck is currently introgressing into the Mallard populations of the Primorsky Krai, possibly due to habitat changes from global warming. The Giant Hawai?i Goose was restricted to the island of Hawai?i and measured 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) in length with a mass of 8.6 kilograms (19 lb), making it more than four times larger than the Nene.\r\n	1905674730	2009-12-20 23:52:50
429	Gulf Fritillary life cycle, an example of holometabolism.. The purpose of this is to protect the chicks from the strong sun more so than keeping them warm. The posterior descending pathway (PDP) is required throughout a bird s life for normal song production, while the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) is necessary for song learning in juvenilles and plasticity/maintenance in adults, but not for adult song production..\r\n	5767679139	2010-08-23 16:12:11
430	The Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) is a bird in the grouse subfamily Tetraoninae of the pheasant family Phasianidae. It waits often motionless for suitable prey such as fish, frogs or crabs to come within reach of its long bill.. Northern gannets also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water..\r\n	1761758570	2009-08-21 20:58:23
431	The smallest known home ranges on record for Golden Eagles are in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, where they range from 1.5 to 9 km2 (0.58 to 3.47 sq mi). Anhingidae are large birds with sexually dimorphic plumage. In North America it winters south of a line from Washington to Idaho and from New Mexico east to Kentucky, also along the Eastern Seaboard as far north as Massachusetts.\r\n	8146729189	2009-08-23 10:18:34
432	The genus Pandion was described by the French zoologist Marie Jules Csar Savigny in 1809, and is taken from a mythical Greek king, Pandion.. Its preferred habitats include humid and moist forests close to rivers, and several types of woodland. In July 2012, Dr Alice Storey et al.\r\n	1982597637	2010-06-11 19:46:50
433	The Mexican population has been increasing since its inception.. Their global population is estimated to be between 58,000 and 77,000 individuals. The legs are feathered to the talons, like the Rough-legged Hawk.\r\n	8956364985	2010-07-22 20:21:38
434	In general, the dietary breadth is greater in Eurasia than it is in North America, where eagles frequently only need to hunt two or three species throughout the nesting cycle. The wing beat has been described as  fluid  by some observers.. However, it seems that Greater Scaup eats larger food items on average, and the species are sympatric in part of their range and presumably have been for millennium without any problems due to competition.\r\n	2187914343	2010-11-27 17:10:44
435	This form of land use may itself be on the way to becoming an endangered species.. Canada Geese have been implicated in a number of bird strikes by aircraft. A decade later the geese had mastered field feeding and had diversified into wheat, corn, sorghum and practically any other field grain they encountered.\r\n	0133845147	2009-07-21 16:29:49
436	In Oklahoma pinyon-juniper habitats, Scaled Quail use the shade of tree cholla (Cylindropuntia imbricata) and human-made structures. 250 individuals, (61 individuals on Isla Mocagua [Bennett 2003]; 40 individuals on Mirit Island. These ducks breed in southern and eastern Europe and southern and western Asia.\r\n	6413694662	2010-05-12 21:38:55
437	They may call at night when alarmed and neighbouring birds may call in a relay like series. Endoparasitic trematodes (Scaphanocephalus expansus and Neodiplostomum spp.) have been recorded in wild Ospreys.. are protected, along with a 50 nmi (93 km) buffer zone around these islands.\r\n	5130325083	2009-03-27 20:24:19
438	The bird s heart has four chambers like a mammalian heart. Display flights seem to be triggered by the presence of other Golden Eagles. Golden Eagles are fairly long-living birds in natural conditions.\r\n	3872885243	2010-11-26 19:44:15
439	Occasionally, Golden Eagles may killed by their prey in self-defense. Harsh calls were made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration  chatter  calls were given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.. Like other guineafowl, this species has an unfeathered head, in this case decorated with a dull yellow or reddish bony knob, and red and blue patches of skin.\r\n	8557841239	2009-12-27 18:21:26
440	Together, these form a group called Paraves. The ratio of the two food types varies by species, with fruit predominating in some species, and arthropods dominating the diet in others. Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such as song rate, which thereby act as reliable indicators of health.\r\n	1413322857	2009-03-19 20:46:17
441	In addition they are able to stand long periods without eating owing to their large fat reserves.. Swainson s Hawks may be largely insectivorous except when nesting. In most places, the Common Merganser is as much a salt-water as a fresh-water frequenter.\r\n	2581216959	2010-10-23 15:54:31
442	There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food have very wide nails. In some species the young from previous broods may also act as helpers for the adults.. The incubation period is about 45 days, both parents feed the young bird and it fledges in about 85 days..\r\n	0976770663	2009-04-21 19:26:56
443	In conservation biology, the concept of evolutionary significant units (ESU) is used, which may define either species or smaller distinct population segments. They are very secretive birds and do not associate with other animals much. Though locally rare, it was not considered a threatened species by the IUCN due to its wide range.\r\n	5018936736	2010-04-12 20:19:12
444	Then the species were unified and moved to the genus Dendragapus, congeneric with the Blue Grouse with which Spruce Grouse often share coniferous habitats. However, Rallus obscurus is something of a mystery as it is generally assumed that at the time of Gmelin s writing, the species was only known from light birds (which were described as sandwichensis on the preceding page of Gmelin s work), but he seems to have seen a specimen of his obscurus at the Leverian Museum.. If the water is replenished too late then the dry pond is inapt for shorebirds and herons..\r\n	8710528904	2010-04-20 19:17:37
445	The female usually is identifiable using the rather dark plumage except the creamy crown, nape and throat. Collection of the swiftlet nests is big business: in one year, more than 3.5 million nests were exported from Borneo to China, and the industry was estimated at $1 billion US per year (and increasing) in 2008. During incubation in Northern Sweden, an incubating adult Golden Eagle was killed on its nest by a Wolverine.\r\n	2854221769	2010-06-26 22:23:30
446	In South America, turkey vultures have been photographed feeding on the fruits of the introduced Oil Palm. Its skulls contain special air sacs that protect the brain from enormous pressure. Although less agile and maneuverable, the Golden Eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the Peregrine Falcons stooping and gliding speeds.\r\n	3128152945	2010-07-26 21:15:16
447	The Wood Stork is a broad-winged soaring bird that flies with its neck outstretched and legs extended. It breeds in the semi-deserts of Turkey and eastwards through Central Asia. When they pair off with mating partners, often one or several drakes end up left out.\r\n	7145983913	2010-02-11 19:39:38
448	At different times, two had been sighted in New England as of 2010.. It mainly lives in coastal areas. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow.\r\n	3118008586	2010-10-23 19:44:26
449	It nests in colonies, often with other auks.. The female is light brown, with plumage much like a female American Wigeon. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish.\r\n	0265499714	2009-06-26 20:24:15
450	The species is most closely related to the Bean Goose Anser fabalis (having even been treated as a subspecies of it at times in the past), sharing a similar black-and-coloured pattern bill, but differing in having pink on the bill and legs where the Bean Goose is orange, and in the paler, greyer plumage tones. The loudest and most commonly heard call is an alarm referred to as  rattle-and-whistle , a gurgling scream made with the head moving side to side. The rectrices and the secondary and tertiary remiges are pure grey, the latter contrasting with the brown forewing and the black primary remiges at the wingtips. It has a bulbous red, yellow and white bill.\r\n	5663284962	2010-05-11 20:33:57
560	These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction.\r\n	0305609630	2010-07-19 18:57:37
561	It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, which is how some species can produce two notes at once..\r\n	8413902143	2010-09-27 15:30:18
451	However, the authors included the Smew therein, and consequently, the bone is more properly assigned to Mergellusespecially as it was more similar to a Smew s than to the Bucephala remains also found at the site. Eggs are about 40 mm in length (1.5 inches) and are tawny olive or buff, marked with blotches of brown. The plumage of the Japanese quail is sexually dimorphic, allowing for differing sexes to be distinguished from one another. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together; in the breeding season they are less social.\r\n	8661901567	2010-03-17 16:10:58
452	It also feeds on aquatic plants, such as seaweeds. It was found that both males and females can discriminate the calls of their mates from others.. There is a long sharp spur on the bend of the wing.. The eggs are incubated only by the female.\r\n	7772906705	2009-10-11 22:40:12
453	The herons are medium to large sized birds with long legs and necks. It and the very similar Long-billed Dowitcher were considered one species until 1950. Vagrant individuals also occur each year in Central America as far south as Costa Rica between October/November and May/June.. Nests are located from nine to 15 feet above the ground, often in the shaded canopy but near the top of the tree.\r\n	9684598972	2010-01-19 18:34:27
454	I have frequently seen, with my own eyes, more than a thousand of these small bodies of birds, hanging down on the sea-shore from one piece of timber, enclosed in their shells, and already formed. The adult is about 4650 cm long and weighs about 780-785 g. Although they usually feed close to the surface, they are capable of diving to depths of 60 m (200 ft).. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 7501800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands.\r\n	6820828762	2009-10-23 16:17:52
455	Outside of the nesting season, they usually feed in flocks. The generic term Cathartes means  purifier  and is the Latinized form from the Greek kathartes/?a?a?t??. Migratory and wintering flocks of Snow Geese can attract Golden Eagles. from approximately 55,000 acres of rice in Texas.\r\n	4203471464	2009-02-27 13:48:32
456	when these methods prove inadequate in. This supports the differential allocation theory, which predicts that parents invest more in the care of their offspring when paired with attractive mates.. Bewick s Swan is one of the birds to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.. In the United States, there has been a history of concern for this species in many states with declines noted, but in 1988, one study suggested that the population in California and locally elsewhere may have increased significantly.\r\n	0783229789	2010-05-24 20:26:35
457	Immature birds resemble the adults.. These birds stalk their prey in shallow water, often running or stirring the water with their feet or flicking their wings to disturb prey; they may also stand still and wait to ambush prey. The Snail Kite and Hook-billed Kites are specialists in consuming snails. As the name implies, these are noisy birds with a clear whistling kee-wee-ooo call..\r\n	8341947966	2009-09-24 12:51:36
458	Family groups remain together until fall.. The nest is also unusual: a grass dome with one entrance, more elaborate than most nests in the family. The family is of cultural importance to the inhabitants of Papua New Guinea. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white back, and yellow-green head with the large circular white eye patches which give the species its name.\r\n	2244889291	2009-12-24 15:53:47
459	Migrating Trumpeter Swans, which are the largest waterfowl on earth.. Eagles raised at latitudes greater than 60 N are usually migratory, though a short migration may be untaken by those who breed or hatch at about 50 N. The dark and white morph is thought to be controlled by a single allele with the dark character being incompletely dominant over the gene for white.. The Victorian writer on Dartmoor, William Crossing, noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places.\r\n	3689837487	2010-03-15 20:42:43
460	Another drake was seen in Vadso harbour, Varanger, Norway on 7 April 1995; a photograph of this bird was published accompanying Forsman (1995).. A further common cause of mortality is natural predation. Biannual surveys conducted by the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) found that between 1998 and 2003 the inter-island coot population averaged 2,100 birds, ranging between 1,500 and 3,000 birds. The now extinct Haast s Eagle (Harpagornis moorei), which existed alongside early aboriginal people in New Zealand, was easily the largest eagle known and perhaps the largest raptor ever.\r\n	2476692978	2009-01-12 14:31:47
461	and the result clearly proves, what is in fact now admitted on all hands, that Swallows do not in any material instance differ from other birds in their nature and propensities [for life in the air]; but that they leave us when this country can no longer furnish them with a supply of their proper and natural food .... The Roald Dahl novel Danny the Champion of the World dealt with a poacher (and his son) who lived in the United Kingdom and illegally hunted Common Pheasants.. Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world s oceans and in them, with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft).. Large concentrations of Ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years.\r\n	1238260944	2010-12-24 14:56:53
462	Once the adults are mated they seek out their own territories and often live close to ducks and gulls, which may take advantage of the swan s ability to reach deep water weeds, which tend to spread out on the water surface.. These threats remain, but the Baikal Teal is recovering, with increased numbers of wintering birds and some increase in habitat area. Many species of terns nest in colonies on the ground. Cormorants and anhingas are extremely similar as regards their body and leg skeletons and may be sister taxa.\r\n	4217398884	2009-01-24 20:32:18
463	Russian Tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) made up 31.9% of the prey in 5 nests in Turkmenistan and 25.4% of the prey in 36 nests in Kazakhstan. Typical measurements of the wing are 4546 cm (1818 in) in males, 37.544 cm (14.817.3 in) in females; the bill is about 8.79.8 cm (3.43.9 in) long in males and 7.58.5 cm (3.03.3 in) in females. Although it has vanished from much of its historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41N and 62N. There it was found that the hunting of domestic stock peaks during wet, cold springs that seemed to adversely effect the local abundance of jackrabbits.\r\n	2319182331	2010-06-28 21:28:19
464	From 10 days to 45 days of age, the nestlings eat much more food and grow considerably. This phalarope breeds in the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. Some Canada Geese have taken up permanent residence as far south as Florida, in places such as retention ponds in apartment complexes. She also has a distinct light eyebrow bordered by a darker crown.\r\n	2950696537	2009-10-19 20:17:19

564	In North Dakota, Green-winged Teal generally begin nesting in late April.\r\n	6116201414	2010-05-11 21:11:13
465	Overall, the species is not threatened, though illegal persecution by game fishing interests is a problem in some areas.. (This appears to be the primitive condition among birds,though most birds have lost the phallus.) The length is thought to be related to sperm competition in species that usually mate many times in a breeding season; sperm deposited closer to the ovaries is more likely to achieve fertilization. The chicks fledge at around 36 days old, though breeding maturity isn t reached until 2 years in females and 3 years in males.. It is a large, chunky, brown bird, very similar to the Eurasian Great Bittern (Botaurus stellaris), though slightly smaller.\r\n	3305526713	2009-03-27 21:18:19
466	The call is a raucous crow-like caw, caw.. Wilson s Plover is a coastal wader which breeds on both coasts of the Americas from the equator northwards. Smaller species may produce clutches of 23. Scaled Quail feed in alfalfa (Medicago spp.) fields..\r\n	5799162078	2009-09-17 13:17:56
467	A story in the Uttara Ramayana describes the head of the Devas, Indra, who unable to defeat Ravana, sheltered under the wing of peacock and later blessed it with a  thousand eyes  and fearlessness from serpents. A 2010 study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills by Chesser and colleagues found that the Roseate and Yellow-billed Spoonbills were each other s closest relative, and the two were descended from an early offshoot from the ancestors of the other four spoonbill species. Female paradise-kingfishers are known to use their long tails to clear the loose soil.. Yet another view  not incompatible with either of those discussed above  connects the species with the Muisca, a Native American nation in today s Colombia.\r\n	9976328843	2010-08-16 15:43:52
468	The nest is around 1 meter (3 ft) in diameter. The resulting improvement in aerodynamics may lower energy expenditure. The same disjunct distribution pattern was also historically found in the local Sandhill Cranes.. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.\r\n	6679887141	2010-07-25 23:28:36
469	Seven to 15 days after the birds arrive, the males begin constructing nests on the ground, ledges or in a trees. The breeding season varies within South Asia. The Whooping Crane was declared endangered in 1967. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation.\r\n	3925845367	2009-06-23 20:41:43
470	When alarmed, the Least Bittern freezes in place with its bill pointing up, turns its front and both eyes toward the source of alarm, and sometimes sways to resemble wind-blown marsh vegetation. The Buffy-crowned Wood Partridge (Dendrortyx leucophrys) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. It is found in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. The Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture, and is less heavily built..\r\n	7660973132	2010-04-13 16:39:20
471	Identifying and naming species is the providence of alpha taxonomy.. he Cackling Goose was originally considered to be the same species or a subspecies of the Canada Goose, but in July 2004 the American Ornithologists  Union s (AOU) Committee on Classification and Nomenclature split the two into two species, making Cackling Goose into a full species with the scientific name Branta hutchinsii. The most prolific natural predators of adult Mallards are Red Fox and hawks, although both kill far fewer than human hunters.. The call is a loud croaking  fraaank .\r\n	8965495112	2010-04-23 11:14:47
472	In some areas, though, the breeding success rate is considerably greater and, occasionally, all cygnets may reach maturity. The males of the southern subspecies have greyer upperparts and tail with extensive black markings, making them appear far darker than the northern subspecies. This characteristic of New World Vultures has been used by humans: ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the foraging vultures.. Some temperate region insects are capable of activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go into a state of torpor.\r\n	0325595942	2010-11-25 10:59:24
473	The clutch size can be anywhere from one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. It breeds in interior North America, moving south and to the coasts, as far as Central America and South America, in winter.. In Scotland, egg-laying occurs in March to mid-April. Adults have a grey-brown back and wings, a white belly, and a white breast with one black neckband.\r\n	2691827230	2010-09-22 12:45:43
474	Divorce is uncommon in procellariiforms and usually only occurs after several years of breeding failure. Additionally, mated females have testosterone concentrations that are 7 times higher than those of unmated females.. One native North American pheasant known to be occasionally hunted is the Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), the largest species of galliform. Or they can choose some compromise between speed and range..\r\n	8306667028	2010-07-13 22:12:41
475	The feet go from flesh-colored at hatching to grey to black, thence finally to yellow. In particular, flamingos have a trachea that is longer than its body length with 330 cartilaginous rings. One description referred to the  wavering  alarm call and  breathy  notes, while other authors describe screams similar to those of the Red-tailed Hawk (B. Bird s feet are classified as anisodactyl, zygodactyl, heterodactyl, syndactyl or pamprodactyl.\r\n	2412274097	2010-10-10 17:56:29
476	While in flight, their long necks are kept straight and their long dark legs trail behind. Rock outcrops, shallow canyons, and gullies may characterize some habitats. However, more recent studies have shown that a limited ability to taste is indeed present. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades.\r\n	4355186542	2009-10-24 13:53:54
477	Large gathering of Golden Eagles sharing carrion while two Steller s Sea Eagles look on. Juvenile Imperial Eagles are much paler overall (caramel-cream in the Spanish; cream and tawny streaks in the Eastern) and are not likely to be confused. Many bird populations migrate long distances along a flyway. The Red-necked Grebe is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.\r\n	1157325067	2009-03-17 12:38:42
478	Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa (Japan) actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds. This effort and the problem of imprinting is explored in the 1976 documentary A Great White Bird.. It is a very small bittern; measuring 2536 cm (9.814.2 in) in length, 4058 cm (1623 in) across the wings and weighing 59150 g (2.15.3 oz).

480	Body mass is from 51 to 102 g (1.8 to 3.6 oz), with most birds between 73 and 95 g (2.6 and 3.4 oz), making this perhaps the lightest of all herons. There is an unconfirmed record of birds on Astola Island of Pakistan in the Arabian Sea. In the British Isles, home to more than 20% of the North Western European population, it is best known as a winter visitor, although it is more frequently seen in southern and eastern England, especially around the Ouse Washes, the Humber and the North Kent Marshes, and in much smaller numbers in Scotland and western parts of England. Adult or fledged juveniles of various bird species have also been predaceously attacked.\r\n	3173392082	2009-08-14 19:33:22
481	This can include nesting sites in urban areas such as roof gardens, enclosed courtyards, and flower boxes on window ledges and balconies more than one story up, which the ducklings cannot leave safely without human intervention. Pelagic Cormorants (presumably P. The subject bird is believed extinct and last documented in 1962, sharing all of the same ornithological and natural history characteristics of this bird, albeit referred to as  stilted .. The extensive white in the wings is obvious in flight, less so on the ground; it is formed by the secondary remiges while the primaries are black; the wing-coverts are brown.\r\n	6867809176	2010-08-10 16:47:42
482	Small numbers are thought to occur in Hildago (Howell and Webb 1992, Gmez de Silva and Aguilar Rodrguez 1994, J. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Adults are 2838 cm (1115 in) long with a 7684 cm (3033 in) wingspan and a body mass of 162270 g (5.79.5 oz).\r\n	7232753285	2009-04-13 21:45:36
483	They are located the premotor cortex.. Currently, there are two competing models that elucidate the role of LMAN in generating an instructive error signal and projecting it to the motor production pathway:. Adults who bred in northeastern Hudson Bay area of Canada reached their wintering grounds, which range from central Michigan to southern Pennsylvania to northeastern Alabama, in 26 to 40 days, with arrival dates from November to early December. Other unusual bird species taken include American Kestrel, and young Short-eared Owls.\r\n	3770599253	2010-09-21 12:29:17
484	Immature birds are similar to Grey-headed Albatrosses but the latter have wholly dark bills and more complete dark head markings.. There was a pronounced decline in American White Pelican numbers in the mid-20th century, attributable to the excessive spraying of DDT, endrin and other organochlorides in agriculture as well as widespread draining and pollution of wetlands. The birds blood and feathers were also used to cure diseases. In May 2011, there were 78 mating pairs and 279 total birds..\r\n	0919970924	2009-05-11 13:27:55
485	It also occurs in continental South America south to the Paraguay River region in eastern Paraguay, southeastern Brazil and the extreme northeast of Argentina, and as a vagrant on Trinidad.. Many seabirds show remarkable site fidelity, returning to the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. Each bird stays within a fairly small area. However their hardiness is such that individuals often remain through cold northern winters, as well, so long as fish-bearing waters remain unfrozen (which may be the case only in flowing water such as streams, creeks and rivers)..\r\n	3269496855	2010-12-23 17:36:17
486	Sodium is then circulated to the kidney where the plasma undergoes filtration by the renal glomerulus. A captive Aquila chrysaetos canadensis shows the typical rusty coloration of the race. This species ranges from 75 to 110 cm (30 to 43 in) in length and has a 127185 cm (5073 in) wingspan.

Its rump and underparts are white, and its underwing is white with a black tip with a narrow black margin at the leading edge. A frequent maneuver is  kiting   coming to a stop, the bird heads into the wind, with its wings held stationary.\r\n	0096111014	2009-12-22 17:44:54
489	Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species  association with cattle. The Western Willet breeds in freshwater prairie marshes in western North America. Zone-tails also eat various young birds, having been observed preying on nestlings and fledgings of species as varied as herons and passerines. Of wild species of ungulate, deer are the preferred prey family.\r\n	2551211495	2009-02-26 11:13:41

495	Hunting for plumes and habitat destruction have reduced some species to endangered status; habitat destruction due to deforestation is now the predominant threat.. hypoleucos), the Old World sister species of Spotted Sandpiper (A. However, the Cackling Goose is usually considerably smaller, scarcely larger than a Mallard with a much shorter neck and smaller bill.. Calls are also made on flight, when a female is away form then territory too long or if a male cant find a chick..\r\n	1373286901	2010-01-20 22:52:21
496	Due to their method of using intimidation while encountering other water and raptorial birds, the species has been referred to as a  merciless tyrant . They are found in the open early in the mornings and tend to stay in cover during the heat of the day. It was also discovered that younger broods (those less than six weeks old) had three times the rate of pecking than older broods. Within a species not all populations may be migratory; this is known as  partial migration .\r\n	0205790317	2009-04-21 22:30:33
497	This species is the only one in the genus Oreortyx, which is sometimes included in Callipepla. Since birds are highly visible and common animals, humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man. This, combined with a rapid heartbeat (the resting heart rate of a small songbird is about 500 beats per minute; that of a hummingbird is about 1,000 beats per minute) satisfies the rigorous metabolic demands of flight. On the one hand, its larger size and long-legged stance, and the breast pattern which gradually fades away on the belly as in the Ruff instead of having a fairly sharp border as in the Calidris/Erolia stints indicate that placement in Philomachus may be correct.\r\n	0818165830	2009-05-24 20:36:49
498	It has an occurrence range of 140,000 km2 (54,000 sq mi).. During migration it has also been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both Turkey Vultures and King Vultures, due to their larger size..

These birds commonly weigh around 1,750 g (3.86 lb), though can weigh as little as 1,361 g (3.000 lb) in P. A study comparing the correlation between water availability and flamingo population determined that the number of flamingos was strongly correlated to the proportion of water in the lake.\r\n	6145289701	2010-07-15 22:16:51
500	Like the Turkey Vulture, this vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged stance. The wetter areas provide a source of food, the mounds and slopes may be used for leks, and dry areas with sedge or low scrub offer nesting sites. The bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. The Grey-headed Chachalaca (Ortalis cinereiceps) is a member of an ancient group of birds of the Cracidae family, which are related to the Australasian mound builders.\r\n	0868361505	2009-01-20 17:28:19
501	The following are various reportages of the significance of eagles, many likely pertaining to the Golden Eagles, in early cultures and older religions as well as national and military insignias.. Communication through bird calls can be between individuals of the same species or even across species. It is found on all continents except Antarctica, although in South America it occurs only as a non-breeding migrant.. The sexes also differ in weight, with males weighing 290 to 400 g (10 to 14 oz), with an average of 350 g (12 oz), and females weighing 390 to 750 g (14 to 26 oz), with an average of 530 g (19 oz).\r\n	2639011540	2009-04-19 15:31:28
502	One cost of nocturnal migration is the loss of sleep. Occasionally tackling larger vertebrate prey such as water snakes (Xenochrophis piscator), Sarus Cranes may in rare cases feed on the eggs of birds and turtles. The male will walk with the young during their normal travels in search for food, providing protection. Although parents are hostile to unfamiliar geese, they may form groups of a number of goslings and a few adults, called crches..\r\n	9874087285	2009-08-13 22:30:51
503	More typical in size are young Lark Buntings taken at their fledging time. Aside from being smaller, the female Nene is similar to the male in colouration. One 1778 painting by William Ellis (plate 70) depicts a light bird, possibly the Leiden specimen (which was apparently collected in late January/early February, 1779), and in more recent times, subfossil bones have also been recovered.. Gauthier identified four conflicting ways of defining the term  Aves , which is a problem because the same biological name is being used four different ways.\r\n	9224059507	2010-05-25 18:15:37
504	The bill is large, strong and sharp-edged, the upper mandible terminating in a large hook. Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late September to November, and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in timing and duration to that of the adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.. A much more passive interspecies guild of eagles have been observed in a wooded area of Kazakhstan, consisting of White-tailed, Eastern Imperial and Golden Eagle.

Ultraviolet light is also used in foragingkestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. Scaled Quail lay from 9 to 16 eggs; most clutches are 12 to 14 eggs.\r\n	6028226866	2010-11-17 14:24:18
507	The birds leave winter quarters to breed starting in mid-February. the Ancient Murrelet) the chicks are highly precocial, leaving the nest within two days of hatching and running actively towards the sea, where the parents call to them. The male has a long crest and a black crown, throat and breast contrasting with an otherwise white face. The young birds leave the nest another 30 to 35 days after hatching.\r\n	7901574539	2010-04-23 21:53:21
508	Much of the dispute hinges upon the distinctness of the Caribbean and Central American populations, the second taxon in this species to be described. Hunting, sometimes assumed to have played a major part, probably was not significant as the bird was protected by a kapu which prohibited hunting except by ali?i until 1819 . This strictly coastal plover nests on a bare scrape on sandy beaches or sandbars.. The underwing is similar to the Green-winged Teal also, but has a darker leading edge.\r\n	2677417349	2010-09-17 16:25:37
568	It has always presented something of a riddle to taxonomists, but here it is treated as the sole living member of the family Pandionidae, and the family listed in its traditional place as part of the order Falconiformes.\r\n	2259994144	2010-07-12 15:55:33

509	The legs and feet are a pink, fleshy colour, and the bare flesh around the beak and eyes is brick red. This species eats any small dryland and marsh animals it can catch, or even pirate (as from an Aplomado Falcon in one reported incident). Despite its European breeding range, this species is rare on passage in western Europe, presumably because of the south-easterly migration route.. The Common Pheasant is distinct enough from any other species known to Linnaeus for a laconic [Phasianus] rufus, capte caeruleo   a red pheasant with blue head   to serve as entirely sufficient description.\r\n	0586034743	2009-03-25 18:50:36
510	They also occur in mangrove swamps. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the main threats to Osprey populations were egg collectors and hunting of the adults along with other birds of prey, but Osprey populations declined drastically in many areas in the 1950s and 1960s; this appeared to be in part due to the toxic effects of insecticides such as DDT on reproduction. The Turkey Vulture has a large range, with an estimated global occurrence of 28,000,000 km2 (11,000,000 sq mi). The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the female is larger than the adult male and has a white throat and breast, and the male s scapular feathers have a purple-green sheen.\r\n	9007483541	2010-08-15 17:46:14
511	Manx Shearwaters have nested along the Atlantic coast of northeastern North America since the 1970s and have expanded their breeding range southward into the Gulf of Maine, with a pair confirmed as nesting at Matinicus Rock. Trees may provide perches for avian predators but further work needs to be done on the effects of tree encroachment (Manzer and Hannon 2005).. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The Great Frigatebird weighs from 6401,550 g (1.413.42 lb)..\r\n	1174154212	2009-08-24 15:56:33
512	In fact, this species is the only survivor of a very ancient lineage of cracids that has been evolving independently from all other living members of this family for at least 20, possibly as much as 40 million years.. Not all burrow-nesting species incubate their young directly. Hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with Dwarf Mongooses, in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.. The male of the nominate race, C.\r\n	5258219496	2009-09-19 23:39:37
513	The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. In Nova Scotia, 98% of the diet was comprised by flounders. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.. During singing, activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the motor signal used to generate the song, and the learned prediction of expected auditory feedback based on that motor command.\r\n	7843387979	2010-08-24 14:28:23
514	It is intermediate in appearance between the female Mallard and the American Black Duck.

Penguins represent the only known examples of male-male pairings in seabirds. Its global population estimated to be 3.86.7 million individuals.\r\n	2696823945	2010-05-15 21:28:29
515	Breeding adults have a pink bare face bordered with white feathers (rather than a bluish bare face with no bordering feathers), a grey bill, and brighter colored, redder legs. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Both parents take turns to incubate and the eggs hatch after about 23 to 24 days. On hatching, the goslings accompany the parents on foot to the learest lake, where they fledge after about 56 days.\r\n	1210853604	2009-08-27 15:58:34
516	During the rest of their migration and on the breeding grounds, they ate insects. This bird is 3038 cm long, with a 7689 cm wingspan. For hunters who make a living off of either using the Falcated Duck as a food source or from simple sport hunts, conservationists are looking for alternative employment opportunities.  Hunting of the ruffed grouse is common in the northern and far western United States as well as Canada, Often done with shotguns.\r\n	9712036736	2010-10-25 11:38:57
517	Most birds winter in the seas around northern Japan with some reaching South Korea and southern Japan. Nearly 95% of seabirds are colonial, leading to the usage, seabird colony, sometimes called a rookery. They will also nest in areas with very short, sparse vegetation. It swims fast and can reach considerable depths and stay submerged for up to a minute.\r\n	8976596694	2010-11-26 16:12:22
518	Females typically lay between 7 and 15 white-tan eggs that incubate for an average of 30 days. The Bean Goose is a goose that breeds in northern Europe and Asia. The Great Egret is partially migratory, with northern hemisphere birds moving south from areas with colder winters. Leslie Brown claimed, to the opposite extreme, that it was physically impossible for a Golden Eagle to kill any ungulate scaling several times their own weight.\r\n	8455345482	2010-08-26 23:23:42
519	A large clutch could indicates brood parasitism by other Greater Scaups or even ducks of other species. He then placed the cover board 30 feet away taking photographs of the cover board. Because of its large size and beauty, the King Vulture is an attraction at zoos around the world. However, other species have greater individual variation.\r\n	8575501110	2010-07-14 13:11:20
520	Although it is sometimes feathered in parrots, the cere is typically bare and often brightly colored. These birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. It is primarily a lowland species but has been recorded at altitudes of up to 1,900 m in Panama and on the northern slope of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala. They are very rare vagrants to western North America and western Europe.\r\n	7487533678	2009-02-19 11:32:19
521	It is quite gregarious outside the breeding season and forms small flocks. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. Its call is a high-pitched scream similar to other buzzards.. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics, however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics.\r\n	6640927681	2009-07-24 18:31:29
522	There is some evidence that increased vulnerability may lead some burrow-nesting species to form colonies, or to nest closer to rival pairs in areas of high predation than they might otherwise do.. The largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the ostrich (Struthio camelus), from the plains of Africa and Arabia. A blackish or dark red knob can be seen at the bill base, and the bare skin of the face is similar to that in color. Birds forage much closer to the Hauraki Gulf over the summer and autumn while incubating an egg and raising a chick  mainly in the Tasman Sea and to the North East of NZ (Bell et al.\r\n	7193623757	2009-08-26 15:40:53
523	Birds have uncinate processes on the ribs. The adult has a black crown, upperparts, wing and tail, a rufous edged white collar, yellow forehead and cheeks, mainly white underparts, and yellow legs. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Degradation of wetland or breeding sites are reasons for abandonment.\r\n	7666277661	2009-01-28 21:58:32
524	Walking slowly and steadily in shallow water up to its belly, it seeks prey, which, like that of most of its relatives, consists of fish, frogs and large insects. During the breeding season, the preference is for grasslands, sage, and other arid shrub country. It was reassigned to the genus Sarcoramphus in 1805 by French zoologist Andr Marie Constant Dumril. Adult male in breeding plumage: white face, throat and fore-crown; grey-brown hind-crown, hind-neck and back; belly white, demarcated with narrow black band and then broad chestnut breast band merging into white throat.\r\n	1575679176	2010-07-18 15:16:11
525	Scutella  scales that are not quite as large as scutes, such as those found on the caudal, or hind part, of the chicken metatarsus.. fulvigula fulvigula (Florida Duck), is resident in central and south Florida and occasionally strays north to Georgia. Homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.. The higher effects of organochlorines in Scotland may be due to the fact that birds there consume a relatively high quantity of seabirds, as opposed to North America, where this practice is rare..\r\n	8412940737	2009-02-27 15:25:19
526	Their nests are built in pines, oaks, Douglas firs, beeches, spruces, and other tree species usually on flat ground rather than on a hillside. This crake migrates to Africa along two main routes: a western route through Morocco and Algeria, and a more important flyway through Egypt. They exceeded 3 m (10 ft) in height and 500 kg (1,120 lb). The external appearance of the adult male and female are identical except that the male is usually slightly larger.\r\n	1170063273	2009-11-21 20:26:23
527	hypoleucos), the Old World sister species of Spotted Sandpiper (A. This is most apparent on islands that have very few (or no) native land mammals, such as Corsica in Italy, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in California and many of the Inner and Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The Red-necked Grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs, which average 3.4 cm (1.3 in) in breadth, 5.1 cm (2.0 in) in length, and weigh about 30.5 g (1.08 oz), of which 10% is shell. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria.\r\n	5304681167	2009-03-25 11:52:56
528	Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with courtship and mating, while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Most birds have approximately 175 different muscles, mainly controlling the wings, skin, and legs. The IUCN classifies this bird as vulnerable due to rapidly declining numbers.\r\n	0113964782	2009-08-12 15:58:54
529	seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. In Guatemala, it has been reported in at least 39 localities and its range has been estimated at 1,139.4 km2 (Rivas Romero and Cbar Carranza 2007). Adult or fledged juveniles of various bird species have also been predaceously attacked. As a whole birds are reportedly more difficult prey to capture than mammals, so hunting success rates may be lower where birds outrank mammals in importance as prey.\r\n	2562014301	2009-01-22 20:15:19
530	Kingfishers and allies (Coraciiformes). The upperparts of worn birds become darker.. King Vultures and Black Vultures, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow them to carcasses. They measure about 80 to 100 cm (2.6 to 3.3 ft) in length, with a wingspan around 120 cm (3.9 ft), and weigh some 1,050 to 1,350 grams (37 to 48 oz).\r\n	7535130884	2009-12-17 12:26:37
531	Red Phalarope is about 21 cm (8 inches) in length, with lobed toes and a straight bill, somewhat thicker than that of Red-necked Phalarope. The contour flight with short glide attack is essentially the one and only hunting technique used by Golden Eagles on ground squirrels. The Purple Heron is a large bird, 7897 cm (3138 in) in length with a standing height from to 70 to 94 cm (28 to 37 in) and a 120152 cm (4760 in) wingspan. In the large species, it is almost always just one egg.\r\n	6956505847	2009-09-23 11:28:40
532	This process allows the beak to work as a  transient thermal radiator , reportedly rivaling an elephant s ears in its ability to radiate body heat. The pair of swans in the Boston Public Garden are named Romeo and Juliet after the Shakespearean couple; however, it was found that both are female.. All individuals are similar in this season. Most mouse-sized mammals are too small to serve as regular prey, but in marginal habitats they can become more important, with studies revealing they sometimes form more than 10% of nest remains.\r\n	4423992558	2010-06-14 14:46:22
533	In winter it forms huge flocks on open land, particularly arable land and mud-flats.. Zygodactyly occurs in the parrots, woodpeckers (including flickers), cuckoos (including roadrunners), and some owls. Finally, the bill is pink with a dark tip. Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances.\r\n	6412019919	2010-08-16 21:13:34
534	One study showed that this is a quite dangerous hunting style. The legs and orbital skin are yellow. It appears all white on the ground, with blackish-gray legs and pink feet. The reasons for mortality include illegal shooting, loss of a satisfactory food supply, harassment, predation, and starvation of nestlings during times of low food supply.\r\n	0223510424	2010-05-15 12:48:43
535	With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and vocalisation, especially duetting, serves this purpose. Differentiating the dark morph from other dark morph Buteos is difficult, especially from the closely related Broad-winged Hawk.. Physically, Snowy Plovers are shorter-legged, paler and greyer above than its Old World sister species, and breeding males lack a rufous cap. They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down.\r\n	8716618971	2009-09-19 15:45:27
536	The Chinese Pond Heron (Ardeola bacchus) is an East Asian freshwater bird of the heron family (Ardeidae).. The herons are a widespread family with a cosmopolitan distribution. The maximum recorded age for a wild Great Black-backed Gull is 27.1 years. As females fly overhead the males waggle their heads from side to side, shake their wings and call.\r\n	4351489161	2009-08-24 17:38:12
537	The forehead and crown are dark brownish with the nape patch being short-feathered and a relatively light rusty color.. These gulls pick food off the water surface, and will also catch insects in the air like a Black Tern.. Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics has usually given Hexapoda the rank of superclass,:180 and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as Entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts. It is not considered a globally threatened species by the IUCN however, as it is widely distributed..\r\n	3944422621	2009-08-19 19:49:50
538	A drake showing characters of both species was present at Cuxhaven, Niedersachsen, Germany on 17 November 1993. Strong winds can blow them inland on occasions, which explains some sighting records away from the coast and their preferred habitats.. Male Muscovy Ducks have spiralled penises which can become erect to 20 cm in one third of a second. Habitat loss is the grebe s biggest threat.\r\n	1134865505	2010-05-10 11:20:40
539	The wild form is also kept in collections, and escapes are not unusual amongst feral flocks of other Anser and Branta geese.. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.. Birds intermediate between the normal morph and the white morph are known as Wrdemann s Heron; these birds resemble a  normal  Great Blue with a white head.. Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate flight..\r\n	1326878319	2009-10-25 18:40:33
540	Females and young birds have shorter crests, and have less strongly marked heads, but plumages are otherwise quite similar.. Initial movement out of the nest is felt to be a response to heat stress as the young quickly move towards shade. The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown, grey or white, and can often be strikingly complex. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe; it excretes a concentrated saline solution from the nostrils..\r\n	3314098807	2010-03-25 19:12:48
541	The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves on the walls of the cage. Peacocks, are a larger sized bird with a length from bill to tail of 100 to 115 cm (40 to 46 inches) and to the end of a fully grown train as much as 195 to 225 cm (78 to 90 inches) and weigh 46 kg (8.813.2 lbs). The standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of 5272 cm (2028 in), a tail length of 26.538 cm (10.415.0 in) and a tarsus length of 9.412.2 cm (3.74.8 in).

At the breeding colony it is quiet above ground but in its burrow makes a growling sound somewhat resembling a chainsaw being revved up.. This small plover is 18 centimetres (7.1 in) long and weighs 35 grams (1.2 oz).\r\n	4692149747	2009-06-17 17:45:36
543	It was in pre-Linnean times known as the Wild Goose ( Anser ferus ). The Wedge-tailed Shearwater is the largest of the tropical shearwaters. Large birds of prey, such as Northern Goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the Gyrfalcon, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.. The Collared Plover is found on sandy coasts, estuarine mud, inland riverbanks and open sandy savannas.\r\n	1365159474	2009-01-19 16:36:23
544	The smaller Pallas s Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus leucoryphus) also overlaps in range with Golden Eagles but there is no published information on their relationship.. By 1860, the ducks disappeared from all but Laysan Island (the ducks namesake), most likely due to predation by introduced rats. Similar individuals are sometimes found in the extreme northeast and west of the species  range. The common name was formerly spelt as a single word,  Corncrake , but the official version is now  Corn Crake .\r\n	3193784371	2009-03-16 18:45:45
545	She recently hatched a healthy chick which is believed to be her 35th. A few species may opportunistically feed on fruit and in one species, the Palm-nut Vulture, it forms the major part of the diet. Incubation averages 30 days, and nest success is high (79% in one study) compared to ground-nesting species like the Teal.

546	When floating leisurely, they position themselves in water similar to ducks. There are two colour morphs: the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (vulpes is Latin for  fox ), and a dark grey form.. The call can be heard from 1.5 km (1 mi) away, and serves to establish the breeding territory, attract females, and challenge intruding males. The most important breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway has expanded to the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands.\r\n	8780948322	2010-05-16 16:17:41
547	In some locations such as the Cape Verde Islands, they nest on cliffs. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) normally form at least 90% of the food fed to chicks. The skull consists of five major bones: the frontal (top of head), parietal (back of head), premaxillary and nasal (top beak), and the mandible (bottom beak).\r\n	3183400307	2009-06-13 12:57:18
548	The light morph is rarer and very distinct with only slight black speckles on an otherwise all white look. The classification of birds is a contentious issue. Male Great Frigatebirds are smaller than females, but the extent of the variation varies geographically. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators.\r\n	2905452888	2010-03-17 14:26:48
549	As primary forest species (especially the guans and curassows), cracids are also particularly. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together..

613	Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world s oceans and in them, with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft).. It is believed to have expanded its traditional range with the increased availability of open water due to gravel extraction, and the spread of freshwater mussels, a favourite food.\r\n	0539832471	2009-10-21 17:57:39
614	On the other hand, the narrow time frame in which Lesser Scaup breed and raise their young may be tied to some specific ecological conditions  such as abundance of key food items  which shifted winterwards due to global warming, without the ducks being able to adapt. It is highly migratory over most of its extensive range, wintering further south as far as north Africa, northern India, Pakistan, and parts of China.\r\n	7354049384	2010-06-20 16:29:28
615	Hybrids between Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Ducks are recognizable by very dark wings contrasting with a light grey underside more than in the Lesser Scaup but less than in the Ring-necked Duck.. The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland.\r\n	6967091032	2009-02-13 16:41:21

The Asian birds winter at sea from Japan to the East China Sea, and American breeders winter in the Pacific, mainly from southern Alaska to British Columbia (with smaller numbers south to California), and in the Atlantic from Newfoundland and Labrador to Florida. Second, they generated alternative predictions regarding time since divergence estimated from mtDNA: falcated ducks and gadwalls would have diverged between 65,000 and 700,000 years before present (ybp) under the introgression hypothesis and between 11,000 and 76,000 ybp under the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis.\r\n	4747976245	2009-11-24 16:43:30
651	Both Giant Petrels have legs that are stronger and thus can move around on land rather effectively. Some of the known types of dimorphisms in the brain include the size of nuclei, the number of neurons present, and the number of neurons connecting one nucleus to another. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs of the host Mallard, although the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.\r\n	5624038270	2010-08-16 14:41:58

662	These young birds actually catch more fish when in the presence of the Snowy Egret and also gain a measure of protection from predators when they mix into flocks of white herons. It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English pophyn or poffin) used for the cured carcasses. Some 22% of surviving young either remained on the island, or returned at maturity to join the breeding population.\r\n	5536721414	2010-05-16 15:32:31
663	It also occurs throughout the Caribbean, on both coasts of Mexico (from Baja California southwards) and Central America, and as far south as Columbia and Venezuela. Manx Shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside Puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the Puffin s living quarters resulting in the loss of the egg. Within this buffer zone longline fishing is outlawed.\r\n	2419931121	2010-07-27 19:54:42

The incubation period is about 45 days, both parents feed the young bird and it fledges in about 85 days.. Due to their method of using intimidation while encountering other water and raptorial birds, the species has been referred to as a  merciless tyrant .\r\n	8110302844	2010-02-20 19:19:34
677	It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, and particularly in autumn it is sometimes seen passing through the Marianas on migration; on Palau, further off its usual migration route, it is decidedly uncommon on the other hand. If caught unaware in the nest, the hen bird will not leave the nest until approached very close. This project uses isolation rearing of young Whooping Cranes and trains them to follow ultralight aircraft, a method of re-establishing migration routes pioneered by Bill Lishman and Joe Duff when they led Canada Geese in migration from Ontario, Canada, to Virginia and South Carolina in 1993.\r\n	9478877473	2010-04-19 21:36:32

The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood.\r\n	1154270081	2010-08-22 13:12:46
687	However, both are generally dominated by the much larger eagle and will actively avoid nesting in the same area as a Golden Eagle pair. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching. When feeding, a Red Phalarope will often swim in a small, rapid circle, forming a small whirlpool.\r\n	9819551761	2010-08-22 13:59:20
688	A small minority of researchers, such as paleornithologist Alan Feduccia of the University of North Carolina, oppose the majority view, contending that birds are not dinosaurs, but evolved from early reptiles like Longisquama.. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms. This latter group is certainly not a natural one, and even after the tropicbirds have been recognised as quite distinct, the remaining Pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely monophyletic.\r\n	6146938837	2009-06-20 13:49:33
689	These chicks have blood lead concentrations that cause immunological, neurological, and renal impairments, significantly decreasing their chances of survival.. The Flightless Cormorant of the Galpagos Islands also seems to belong here. Since then it  or at least some of the subspecies associated with it  have been placed either in Euplocamus or Gennceus.\r\n	1577648331	2010-07-16 21:44:53
690	Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African Rail.. The male then participates fully in nest defense, incubation, and chick-rearing. Its global population estimated to be 3.86.7 million individuals.\r\n	9520084356	2010-11-21 13:57:44
691	The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a  Queen Eider ) is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure. ! e expansion time of samples from the Tianshan group (1 920 000 years ago) was. On the open ocean, they are found in areas where converging ocean currents produce upwellings and are often found near groups of whales.\r\n	5485085938	2010-12-21 15:33:51
692	They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. The official 10/3 generation trend is listed by BirdLife International at a 1%9% declinatation, but it is stated that this is a conservative number. While 21 years is generally given as a maximum age, the Gabbert Raptor Center on the University of Minnesota campus is home to a turkey vulture named Nero with a confirmed age of 37.[clarification needed] There is another female bird, named Richard, living at the Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Walnut Creek, CA that hatched in 1974 and arrived at the museum later that year.\r\n	5012493355	2009-03-11 18:46:32
693	The cup nest is smoothly hemispherical inside, with a deep depression to house the eggs. This locally abundant gull breeds in large colonies in reedbeds and marshes, and lays two or three eggs in a nest, which can be on the ground or floating. This is a gregarious species, sleeping at communal roost at night and hunting in loose flocks.\r\n	7254343074	2010-04-14 13:44:16
694	Due largely to the discovery of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous neognath member of the duck lineage, Neornithes is now known to have split into several modern lineages by the end of the Mesozoic era. The Canada Goose also eats beans and grains such as wheat, rice, and corn when they are available. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form..\r\n	5876012477	2010-04-14 22:12:21
695	Mobbing, clearly a group effort, is well-known behavior, not limited to colonial species; the more birds participating in the mobbing, the more effective it is at driving off the predator. Birds breeding at the coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed.. Vagrant individuals also occur each year in Central America as far south as Costa Rica between October/November and May/June..\r\n	0430730391	2009-07-16 12:56:17

Aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of Scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the Nile.\r\n	4902925502	2010-03-27 20:36:46
699	The bird has come to the attention of medical science in recent years as having been an early victim of the H5N1 virus, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza), at Qinghai. Apart from the difference in size, males and females look exactly alike. The female typically lays 1012 eggs in a simple scrape concealed in vegetation, often at the base of a rock or tree.\r\n	9107288009	2010-02-27 16:55:36
700	It is fairly common well off the west coast of the United States during late summer and early autumn, and can generally be observed not far from land along the whole temperate and tropical coastlines of the Americas. The adult males have a striking, swirling black-and-white face pattern. The hybrids have a flatter and larger head and a thicker bill with a pronounced angle on the lower part of the bill, which distinguishes it from the smaller Thayer s Gull..\r\n	1658018684	2009-11-24 18:44:39
701	In southwestern Australia, they are now one of the most commonly recorded raptors in the wheatbelt.. Western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full plumage, their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers. Numbers increase throughout November and peak in December, when flocks of many dozen roam the open lands.\r\n	8413020262	2010-02-24 15:34:20
702	With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. Owls are variable-sized, typically night-specialized hunting birds. The carcasses were often hung for a time to improve the meat by slight decomposition, as with most other game.\r\n	0207715411	2009-05-12 21:53:33
703	Snail Kites are 36 to 48 cm (14 to 19 in) long with a 99120 cm (3947 in) wingspan. It is usually built in not too high off the ground in shrubs or trees but sometimes in sheltered locations on the ground, and often near water. This was shown in an experiment in which females had their flight feathers trimmed, so that they had to expend more energy during flights to obtain food for their broods.\r\n	5558474317	2010-11-22 11:27:52
704	The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. It is in the monotypic genus Zebrilus. A partial survey of under 50% of the North American population published in 2007 found an almost six -fold increase in the last four decades.\r\n	5832367224	2009-05-21 22:42:20
705	The most important wintering area is the Baltic Sea, where a total of about 4.5 million gather.. The range of Anas falcata, in more colloquial terms, is from eastern Siberia and Mongolia to northern Japan with wintering grounds in southeast Asia to eastern India. Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system.\r\n	7276552845	2009-03-24 13:45:50
706	After mounting the female, the male will extend his cloaca by curving his back in an attempt to initiate cloacal contact between him and the female. pomarinus) has been observed to have been predated by Great Black-backed Gulls. Like other members of the heron family, the American Bittern feeds in marshes and shallow ponds, dining on amphibians, fish, insects and reptiles..\r\n	9075606849	2009-05-19 17:14:27

708	There is great variation in flight speeds among the nearly 8,000 species of birds. Chicks are fully fledged within five weeks of hatching and can hunt for mice within a week of leaving the nest. The tail also follows a similar pattern of maturation.\r\n	6508356852	2009-05-21 16:33:28
709	The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. On the other hand, most records are outside the breeding season, more indicative of post-breeding dispersal. The nest is lined with green leaves and felted fur, though linings of grass and cow dung have also been reported.\r\n	3682743968	2009-02-17 15:45:52
710	The Japanese quail is considered to be a closely related allopatric species to the Common quail, though both are still recognized as distinct species. Raccoons, martens, fishers and large arboreal snakes can predate eggs, hatchlings, fledgings and occasionally incubating and brooding adults. The bill is dull yellowish, becoming orange briefly at the start of the breeding season, and the lower legs gray, also becoming orangey at the start of the breeding season.\r\n	8723167420	2010-03-19 14:28:37
711	Two swans are still able to ring for lunch.. The vultures tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcasss bones. This bird is closely related to the more widespread Red Knot.\r\n	8577880361	2010-03-13 12:19:16

713	Rather than directly killing the nestlings, stormy, wet weather probably causes the most harm to productivity due to the hampering of the parents ability to hunt. When the Puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. One study showed that this is a quite dangerous hunting style.\r\n	5339659385	2009-04-12 17:18:20
714	Preferred prey species can include voles, cotton rats and ground squirrels. A crest on the nape makes the profile distinctively long front-to-back. The wingspan for both subspecies ranges from 135 to 165 cm (53 to 65 in).\r\n	8834855427	2009-12-12 11:26:32
715	It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. The population in the United Kingdom is about 22,000 birds, as of the 20062007 winter, a slight decline from the peak of about 26,000-27,000 birds in 1990. The usual clutch is one to three, usually two white to pale blue eggs.\r\n	1193451027	2009-09-19 17:32:13
716	This of course is not true; there is no real difference in the efficiency of the blood, and both mammals and birds use a hemoglobin molecule as the primary oxygen carrier with little to no difference in oxygen carrying capacity. Flight feathers begin to emerge on the young at nine to 11 days. During cutaneous heat loss, Phoenicopterus ruber relies on evaporation off of the skin to reduce its body temperature.\r\n	2021666470	2010-09-20 12:34:41
717	In the same study green vegetation formed a higher proportion of the diet than reported for other areas.. With a large range and no evidence of significant population decline, this species conservation status is rated by the IUCN as being of Least Concern.. Undoubtedly, they have this inclination in order to repel natural predators, from both themselves and their offspring.\r\n	2195578386	2009-08-26 12:45:50

719	They have an average lifespan of 8 years.. In spring and summer, mating season comes and the adults  bellies of this species turn black whether the bird is still in its wintering place (for example, on a beach in Sanibel Island, Florida) because it does not want to migrate, or in its breeding grounds up in the arctic of northern Canada and Alaska.. The broad shallow nest is built of twigs and vines 13 m up in a tree, often partially screened by vines.\r\n	7662951868	2010-07-10 17:53:53
720	Birds on the east coast of North America are thought to have moved north with Snowy Egrets from the Caribbean. The Sunbittern is a non-migrant bird that is normally found foraging on the ground and scratching for insects. As in other synthliboramphine murrelet species (e.g.\r\n	4117296693	2009-11-22 20:37:11
721	Rarely, they have been also record still hunting from a perch.. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. The standard linear measurements of the Whooping cranes are a wing chord length of 5363 cm (2125 in), an exposed culmen length of 11.716 cm (4.66.3 in) and a tarsus of 2631 cm (1012 in).\r\n	0976346279	2009-05-15 12:35:35
722	On average, birds begin breeding when they reach 8 to 15 years old, after which they breed biennially, fledging a chick every five years or so. The drake or male Greater Scaup is larger and has a more rounded head than the female. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina.\r\n	5119983553	2010-11-10 17:57:28
723	Causes for its demise include habitat loss, introduced predators, and direct human harvesting.. argentatus) and the Lesser Black-backed Gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult Puffin. These introduced animals depredated and altered the nesting colonies, leading to assessment of the petrel as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\r\n	2747567584	2010-01-26 12:53:35

In 2011, captive bred cranes were reintroduced into Thailand. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa (Japan) actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds.\r\n	0549192456	2009-07-28 18:25:12

The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened.:2224 The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages..\r\n	3718555123	2010-09-28 21:58:20
726	The principal threats both in Colombia and Venezuela are habitat alteration and destruction, and. Besides its namesake, wild celery, the Canvasback shows a preference for the tubers of sago pondweed, which can make up 100% of its diet at times. The females have a much paler plumage, especially on the neck and underparts, and are a bit larger overall.\r\n	7959966343	2009-10-22 17:55:59
727	The Ferruginous Hawk is one of the most adaptable nesters of the raptors, and will use trees, ledges, rock or dirt outcrops, the ground, haystacks, nest platforms, power poles, and other man-made structures. The precocial chicks have buff and chestnut down, streaked and barred with black, and frosted with white; they feed themselves on a variety of small invertebrates, but are brooded by the female. In Ethiopia s Bale Mountains, where the vegetation is more lush and the climate is clearly less arid than in Northeastern Africa, the Golden Eagle occupies verdant mountains..\r\n	8986103795	2009-02-26 18:27:27
728	The Black Oystercatcher is restricted in its range, never straying far from shores, in particular favoring rocky shorelines. The nest is a bare scrape on tundra or Arctic moorland. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October.\r\n	6848684882	2010-06-11 12:28:22
729	Hybrid offspring of Hawaiian Ducks seem to be less well-adapted to native habitat, and utilizing them in reintroduction projects apparently reduces success. In winter it forms huge flocks on open land, particularly arable land and mud-flats.. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages.\r\n	7573938972	2010-06-18 22:33:58
730	Atlantic Canada Goose, Branta canadensis canadensis. Even though the chromosome numbers are highly variable between populations, these can interbreed successfully and form a single evolutionary unit. The Red-necked Stint s small size, fine dark bill, dark legs and quicker movements distinguish this species from all waders except the other dark-legged stints.\r\n	4473037609	2010-04-25 16:14:21
731	Increased vulnerability to predators may have led some burrow-nesting species, like the European Bee-eater, to become colonial breeders. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. Perceptions of various bird species often vary across cultures.\r\n	2792178018	2010-06-17 13:21:37

In the extreme southeast and southwest of the breeding range  the Rocky Mountains region of the northwestern USA and the southern Great Lakes  Lesser Scaup are present all-year; it is not clear whether the breeding birds are replaced by migrants from the far north in winter, or whether the local populations do not migrate, or whether both local and migrant birds are found there in winter..\r\n	9860383770	2010-07-22 20:47:55
735	The chest is often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head. The female is almost entirely chocolate-brown. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species.\r\n	5388735332	2010-01-21 18:47:17
737	It is also known as the Willow Grouse and in the British Isles, where it was previously believed to be a separate species, as the Red Grouse. Around 2 to 3 eggs are laid in this nest, these are very hard and can even survive being submerged by a high tide or very high water levels. However, more recent studies have shown that a limited ability to taste is indeed present.\r\n	1668179520	2010-08-16 14:54:17
738	Puffins have been hunted by man since time immemorial. The most important single breeding site, at jrsrver in Iceland (holding 10,700 pairs in 1970), was only discovered in 1951, by Sir Peter Scott and his team who made an expedition to seek the breeding grounds. It breeds in colonies, and has two main breeding areas: one in the southwest Pacific Ocean includes Lord Howe Island (16,900 pairs ) and northern New Zealand (11,000 pairs ); the other is along the coast of Western Australia from Cape Leeuwin to the Recherche Archipelago.\r\n	8738271308	2009-03-20 19:23:13

740	Moreover, it has been observed that during periods of increased temperatures such as mid-day, flamingos will stand on both legs. These birds are opportunistic and have adapted well to taking food discarded or even left unattended by people. An exceptionally large Glaucous Gull was found outweigh any known Great Black-backed Gull, although usually that species is slightly smaller.\r\n	3897761365	2009-07-26 11:10:16
741	Most birds have approximately 175 different muscles, mainly controlling the wings, skin, and legs. The Corn Crake s breeding habitat is grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. They lay this egg between 10 December and 5 January, in their nests, which is a large bowl built of grassy vegetation and soil peat, that is 1 metre wide at the base and half a metre wide at the apex.\r\n	2745077894	2009-06-18 17:25:28

Tufted Puffins are around 35 cm (15 in) in length with a similar wingspan and weigh about three quarters of a kilogram (1.6 lbs). Non-breeding birds, depicted below, do not have the spotted underparts, and are very similar to the Common Sandpiper of Eurasia; the main difference is the more washed-out wing pattern visible in flight and the normally light yellow legs and feet of the Spotted Sandpiper.\r\n	7284714790	2010-12-23 12:19:37
743	Blue-winged Teal often use heavy growth of bulrushes and cattails as escape cover. Webster s Dictionary suggests that herons were given this name because of their habit of defecating when flushed. Nests in Scotland may found at anywhere from 10 to 65 pairs per 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi), with an average of over 20 pairs found per area.\r\n	0194018428	2009-11-19 14:11:39

749	The Collared Plover is found on sandy coasts, estuarine mud, inland riverbanks and open sandy savannas. This specimen is the largest wild goose ever recorded of any species.. By the 19th century most naturalists understood that species could change form over time, and that the history of the planet provided enough time for major changes.\r\n	8687834276	2009-07-15 14:40:32
750	In plants, polyploidy is extremely commonplace with few restrictions on interbreeding; as individuals with an odd number of chromosome sets are usually sterile, depending on the actual number of chromosome sets present, this results in the odd situation where some individuals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with certain others and some cannot, with all populations being eventually linked as to form a common gene pool.. Some musicologists believe that birdsong has had a large influence on the development of music. Similarly, 16 breeding eagles were relocated in Wyoming after relatively heavy levels of lamb depredation.\r\n	4120790711	2010-03-14 13:36:16
751	In Ecuador this species is probably extinct. Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with the mass of the adult bird. This locally abundant gull breeds in large colonies in reedbeds and marshes, and lays two or three eggs in a nest, which can be on the ground or floating.\r\n	8837282686	2009-04-11 12:40:57
752	Red-breasted Nuthatches smear sap around the entrance holes to their nests, while White-breasted Nuthatches rub foul-smelling insects around theirs. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has completed moulting.. The striped young are sometimes carried on the adult s back..\r\n	4379271772	2010-06-22 14:33:25
753	In addition, it has been determined that the Barnacle Goose is a derivative of the Cackling Goose lineage, whereas the Hawaiian Goose is derived from the Canada Goose.. The species, once widespread in the West Indies, is now far less common. Finally, after two or three months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order).\r\n	5623589734	2010-11-12 12:37:43
754	The mother calls them to her, but does not help them in any way. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off and dive together.. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert.\r\n	1500501785	2009-10-20 12:34:39
755	They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. The single egg is buff-white and may have spots. Removal of eggs by farmers (to reduce crop damage) or children (in play), or by migrant labourers for food or opportunistic egg collection during trips to collect forest resources  are prominent causes of egg mortality.\r\n	0256919557	2009-04-27 13:22:38
756	These two species, and the Surf Scoter, are placed in the subgenus Melanitta, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, Black and Common Scoters.. They often nest in colonies, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. Outside the breeding season it migrates further north and most commonly occurs in a broad belt of ocean between Peru and Hawaii..\r\n	6113931599	2010-08-13 19:51:37
757	Guineafowl are equipped with strong claws and scratch in loose soil for food much like domestic chickens, although they seldom uproot growing plants in so doing. Ferruginous Hawks have been known to live for 20 years in the wild, but most birds probably die within the first five years. It is generally common and widespread, though three of its eastern subspecies (oatesi, lineata and crawfurdi) are considered threatened and moffitti is virtually unknown in the wild..\r\n	7817818374	2010-02-28 14:45:36
758	Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. Only a relatively small number of species, including the woodpeckers, are capable of excavating their own cavity nests. When humans approach the nest, the nestlings have been described as uttering croaks, quacks and whistles..\r\n	8331253169	2010-11-22 20:21:53
759	The largest bird ever capable of flight was Argentavis magnificens, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 8.3 m (28 ft), a length of up to 3.5 m (11 ft), a height on the ground of up to 2 m (6.6 ft) and a body weight of at least 80 kg (176 lb).. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Many birds can detect polarised light..\r\n	1067154054	2009-08-28 18:17:48
760	This system is typical in bees and wasps. The Arctic Tern has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding areas. Female northern gannets are not only more selective than males in choosing a search area, they also make longer and deeper dives and spend more time floating on the surface than males..\r\n	7009706497	2010-06-24 22:52:37
761	Owls, which may have dissimilar periods of activity, are not entirely exempt from Golden Eagle predation either. Flight feathers begin to emerge on the young at nine to 11 days. fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female Mallard, with no white edge on the speculum and slightly different bare-part colouration..\r\n	5711608312	2009-06-20 22:51:11
762	There is a rare hypermelanic morph with largely dark plumage. A second possibility is that the genus name is derived from the word numen, meaning  nod , and referring to this species head being bent forward and down. caeruleus is again called Black-winged Kite, while the name Black-shouldered Kite is now reserved for an Australian species, Elanus axillaris, which had also been lumped into E.\r\n	1506829724	2010-11-17 21:52:40
763	In the first 10 days, chicks mainly lie down on the nest substrate. This species is very similar to the slightly larger Spotted Sandpiper (A. In most mound-building species, males do most or all of the nest construction and maintenance.\r\n	9249730902	2010-06-15 14:52:50
764	The management of lekking habitat and winter habitat are not as clearly defined in the literature as nesting and brood rearing habitat assessment and management. The male is typical larger in size, both sexes are similar in appearance  greyish brown birds with light grey breasts dappled with dark brown to black blotches and bars. the nesting season begins in August, with laying occurring around September/October.\r\n	0729631078	2010-08-26 17:27:10
765	Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. They are fed by regurgitation of partly digested food when young, switching to entire food items as they grow older. There are two largely discrete populations of Pink-footed Goose.\r\n	5898551396	2010-04-19 19:16:57
766	These nests are created as parts of large colonies. Another fairly accurate sign is that rump feathers with a single white dot indicate a female; rump feathers with more than one white dot indicate a male.. The predominant theory on why they did not previously occupy them was that territorial Bald Eagles deterred them until DDT use decimated the local Bald Eagle population.\r\n	1964673537	2009-02-16 16:58:27
767	No distinctive character is known and it may be synonymous with either gilliae or sharpii.. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.. A disproportionate amount of Golden Eagle poisonings in Scotland from 1981 to 2000 were linked to grouse moors (where grouse are kept for the pleasure of shooting) and were probably cases of gamekeepers deliberately poisoning eagles and foxes to keep their stock of grouse high.\r\n	9912461964	2010-04-22 20:57:50
768	But the eye area of the female is always darker, making the light eye stand out, while the male s head is altogether not very contrastingly colored and the female lacks the grey wing-patch and tail. Like most Tinamous, it will eat fruit, seeds and invertebrates.. North America has fewer native pheasants species but introduced species such as Grey Partridge, Ring-necked Pheasant and, especially, Chukar are readily hunted (native quail seem to be largely or entirely ignored as prey by Golden Eagle, perhaps because of their small size or dense thicket-dwelling habits).\r\n	5492881875	2009-10-14 22:30:29
769	Wingspan in both the largest cranes and the largest bustards can range up to 2.53 m (8.210 ft).. Song learning in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile listening to the father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template. In breeding plumage, she has grey-brown upperparts with white-fringed, dark-centred feathers.\r\n	4320805227	2009-10-17 23:39:37
770	Nesting White Storks have been protected and held in reverence in many cultures. Northern gannets also forage for fish while swimming with their head under water.. The Parakeet Auklet s food varies with season, during the breeding season it takes mostly small planktonic crustaceans such as euphausiids, copepods and amphipods.\r\n	8637525304	2010-08-15 19:53:39
788	Since the avian integument is not equipped with sweat glands, cutaneous cooling is minimal. This allows the sexes to utilize different ecological niches, thereby reducing intraspecific competition. It breeds on tropical and subtropical islands in the Pacific Ocean.\r\n	0514218800	2009-04-17 15:40:26
789	The breeding season is summer, April to June. The population structure is not well understood. These banding programs yield valuable data about migration patterns, harvest rates, and survival rates..\r\n	2424712738	2010-08-23 18:44:49
771	Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of Sooty Terns and forcing them to disgorge food.. Despite being native to a country where the avifauna generally is relatively well known, it was overlooked until the 1990s due the similarities with the Sage Grouse, and only described as a new species in 2000making it the first new avian species to be described from the USA since the 19th century. Eudocimus and Plegadis), the white patch forms a broad white band on the upperwing that separates the black remiges and the grey lesses wing-coverts.\r\n	8703655659	2009-06-14 10:23:11
772	When disturbed at the nest, they may utter a long, lower-pitched raaaaauu.. It lays one white egg, the timing of laying varying from island to island, on some islands breeding throughout the year. They exhibit strong philopatry, returning to their natal colony to breed and returning to the same nesting site over many years.\r\n	0757478699	2009-07-27 21:48:53
773	Studies of Wandering Albatross have shown over 10% of chicks are extra-pair young; an extremely surprising result since adult Wandering Albatrosses only breed once every other year at most. The Guanay Cormorant is similar in coloration to the Rock Cormorant, Phalacrocorax magellanicus, but larger, measuring 78 cm from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail. The overall impression of standing birds is gray, with flying birds showing conspicuous white rear parts (lower back, belly, and tail).\r\n	4613410640	2009-08-23 14:15:25
774	The two sexes are a similar size.. Meal size increases throughout the nesting season, the estimated morsel of flesh fed to the young ranged from 6 mm (0.24 in) at hatching to 15 mm (0.59 in) at fledging. The bare red skin of the adult s head and neck is brighter during the breeding season.\r\n	9303735692	2009-05-23 10:33:35
775	Adult males ranges from 4552 cm (1820 in) and from 888 to 1,400 g (1.958 to 3.086 lb), while females range from 4050 cm (1620 in) and from 500 to 1,182 g (1.102 to 2.606 lb). Retrievers, spaniels, and pointing breeds are used to hunt pheasants.. The Black-footed Albatross, along with the Laysan Albatross and the rare Short-tailed Albatross, are the three species of albatross that range in the northern hemisphere, as opposed to the rest of the family which range from the Equator south.\r\n	0297631741	2009-07-17 15:20:31
776	They also have duskier heads and brighter rufous tails than do brown morph birds.. It was known as Mardungurra among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara.. In South America, it does not live west of the Andes, except in western Ecuador, north-western Colombia and far north-western Venezuela.\r\n	8432113555	2009-11-27 20:25:30
777	Sharp-tailed grouse historically occupied eight Canadian provinces and 21 U.S. However, many accipitrids have been recorded as capturing and then flying with prey of equal weight or even slightly heavier than themselves in their talons, a feat that requires great physical strength. The New World vultures are still generally considered a member of this order,although the inclusion is dubious at best.\r\n	8000251557	2010-08-27 17:36:30
778	Because it lacks a syrinx, the Black Vulture, like other New World Vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. The only other very large, long-legged white birds in North America are: the Great Egret, which is over a foot shorter and one-seventh the weight of this crane; the Great White Heron, which is a morph of the Great Blue Heron in Florida; and the Wood Stork. Ruffs of both sexes have an additional moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the Bar-tailed Godwit.\r\n	4650719158	2010-01-25 15:55:35
779	The incubation responsibilities are shared by both parents. In March the population on the breeding area increased again, with most birds in groups of four to eight.. There are seven subspecies of this bird, of varying sizes and plumage details, but all are recognizable as Canada Geese.\r\n	0182527237	2010-05-26 13:53:43
780	As neither the Small Asian Mongoose nor mosquitoes (which transmit fowlpox and avian malaria, both exceptionally lethal to Hawaiian endemic birds) were present on Big Island until 1883 and the 1890s, respectively, this species  extinction was probably caused by introduced European rats, cats and possibly dogs. The cliff nest of a Golden Eagle. The wings are whitish with black flight feathers below, and from above show a white-bordered green speculum and white tertials.\r\n	8236679661	2010-07-26 14:24:36
781	From the Early to the Late Pleistocene, a prehistoric species of Black Vulture, Coragyps occidentalis, known as the Pleistocene Black Vulture or  somewhat in error  the  Western Black Vulture , occurred across the present species  range. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. It mostly moves by paddling along efficiently with its webbed feet and seldom takes to the air.\r\n	3953071547	2009-09-18 17:16:14
782	Not all burrow-nesting species incubate their young directly. During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female Mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.. Chicks increase in size to 560 g (larger than the adults) then drop to around 430 g before fledging.\r\n	5256844586	2009-12-27 13:13:25
783	A study in Belarus showed grouse were the most common family of prey at 47.8% of the eagle diet. those that thrive with new opportunities and those. The species name is derived from Latin word papa  bishop , alluding the bird s plumage resembling the clothing of one.\r\n	3071835684	2009-07-18 15:23:22
784	There is an active recovery plan in Alaska.. Some shorebirds also soak their breast feathers with water and then sit on the eggs, providing moisture to enable evaporative cooling. In Britain, occasional small flocks occur, including five at Loch Leven[disambiguation needed], Scotland in September 2003.\r\n	8627831533	2009-05-25 11:14:14
785	Although there is ongoing habitat loss, and the species has a limited range and is hunted for food, Elliot s Pheasant is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as it does not appear to be declining appreciably in numbers. Another contributor to habitat fragmentation for grouse is unmonitored and excessive cattle grazing (Kirsch et al. The main structure of an insect s digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body.\r\n	1517501752	2010-10-16 16:34:40
786	The Black-eared Wood Quail (Odontophorus melanotis) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. Because of this they are now very rare in many parts of the UK, and under threat in many more areas.. This family is very closely related to the other families in the suborder Sulae, i.e.\r\n	2488282647	2010-12-15 20:18:49
787	Additional prey items reported include reptiles such as iguanas, tejus and snakes. In most cases, the Golden Eagle is reportedly dominant over White-tailed Eagles at food, reportedly being more aggressive and a more agile and swift flier. The Broad-billed Sandpiper is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies..\r\n	0766764846	2010-06-22 11:14:12

790	ayresii), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated Spilornis serpent-eagle genus. In territorial songbirds, birds are more likely to countersing when they have been aroused by simulated intrusion into their territory. In South America it occurs as far south as Argentina.\r\n	9539912960	2010-01-12 10:36:21
791	The plumage varies with age, with the juveniles starting chocolate brown. The lined nest is built on tundra close to the sea, and 59 eggs are laid. Males are larger than females and have a larger knob on their bill.\r\n	1135843462	2010-07-21 16:54:16
792	The population of Greater Snow Geese was in decline at the beginning of the 20th century, but has now recovered to sustainable levels. It has a white face and black head, neck, and upper breast. The pair will touch talons in flight as the female rolls on her back.\r\n	5405680534	2010-09-25 15:30:40

The closest evolutionary relatives of the Labrador Duck are apparently the scoters (Melanitta).. from rice operations will likely occur more often as.\r\n	6568394175	2009-03-14 18:31:11
794	Only in the North American population of Buteo brachyurus does it seem to be the prevalent form.. Originally placed into a single genus, Diomedea, they were rearranged by Reichenbach into four different genera in 1852, then lumped back together and split apart again several times, acquiring 12 different genus names in total (though never more than eight at one time) by 1965 (Diomedea, Phoebastria, Thalassarche, Phoebetria, Thalassageron, Diomedella, Nealbatrus, Rhothonia, Julietata, Galapagornis, Laysanornis, and Penthirenia).. habitat destruction has contributed heavily to the rapid decline of cracids over the past several.\r\n	0838020347	2010-07-11 16:13:26
795	Guineafowl are particularly well-suited to consuming massive quantities of ticks, which might otherwise spread lyme disease. An old name for the Whooper Swan is  Elk ; it is so called in Francis Willughby and John Ray s Ornithology of 1676.. Thomas Bewick s A History of British Birds (Volume 1, 1797) mentions a report from  a very intelligent master of a vessel  who,  between the islands of Minorca and Majorca, saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward , and states the situation in Britain as follows:.\r\n	8147483153	2010-12-28 20:42:20
796	Human activities have threatened many migratory bird species. This can be from a perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose..\r\n	1495726289	2010-10-24 12:32:16
797	The Ruddy Crake (Laterallus ruber) is a bird in the rail family, Rallidae. Least Grebes breed throughout the year. In discontinuous gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest.\r\n	2288972638	2010-04-27 18:30:33
798	Flocks of up to 400 birds may be seen flying together during migration. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. On clear mornings (and occasionally in late afternoons), the Tiny Hawk will sometimes sun itself on a high open branch.\r\n	5982659313	2009-10-24 11:49:22

Introduced and feral populations of its domestic breeds occur in many places outside its natural range.\r\n	1848870355	2009-11-25 12:45:10
800	However, these pair bonds occasionally dissolve or are forced apart while both members of the pair are still alive, a process known as divorce. A supposed King Vulture relative from Quaternary cave deposits on Cuba turned out to be bones of the eagle-sized hawk Buteogallus borrasi (formerly in Titanohierax).. At a distance, the Rock Shag is a black and white bird, with head, neck and upperparts black and chest and underparts white.\r\n	6068415112	2009-09-28 18:53:50

802	Blue-winged Teal use rocks protruding above water, muskrat houses, trunks or limbs of fallen trees, bare stretches of shoreline, or mud flats for resting sites.. The bird has come to the attention of medical science in recent years as having been an early victim of the H5N1 virus, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza), at Qinghai. The American Wigeon is a noisy species, and in the field can often be identified by their distinctive calls.\r\n	8929864106	2010-10-12 23:34:16
803	Young birds sometimes die after falling off from the nest platform. Young fledglings will also engage in play; with one bird picking up a stick and being chased by one or more other fledglings. Just before migration, the Ruff increases its body mass at a rate of about 1% a day, much slower than the Bar-tailed Godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate.\r\n	7801536293	2010-02-26 11:50:20
804	In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at Embalse Cerrn Grande, Laguna El Jocotal, and especially Lago de Gija. Moreover, it has been observed that during periods of increased temperatures such as mid-day, flamingos will stand on both legs. The Mallard was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae, and still bears its original binomial name..\r\n	6570762933	2010-03-20 13:56:30
805	The avian visual system is usually highly developed. James Clements did not adopt the split, the ACAP has not yet adopted the split, and the SACC recognizes the need for a proposal.. Male Mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species, and even each other, in the same way.\r\n	4898004417	2009-08-26 22:45:23
806	Bumblebee defecating: Note the contraction of the anus which provides internal pressure.. Snow Geese now feed in grain fields as soon as they reach the prairies in September, and they continue to use agricultural fields until they leave the prairies in April and May on their way to Arctic breeding areas.. Carotenoids act as antioxidants and stimulants for the Blue-footed Booby s immune function, suggesting that carotenoid-pigmentation is an indicator of an individual s immunological state Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a booby.\r\n	1972591723	2009-03-19 13:39:31
807	Initiative programs have also removed invasive. This suggests that individuals occasionally become lost during migration, and/or that they may spend a whole year in the tropical regions and range about, rather than just overwintering at one site.. The elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking, a head-lowered  cat  display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a  penguin  dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast..\r\n	6526292924	2009-04-16 19:41:30
808	Each bird stays within a fairly small area. Females can also induce the initial sexual interactions by walking in front of a male and crouching. The fledged juveniles will stay in the territory until the next breeding season.\r\n	1066599194	2010-02-19 22:18:36

Distributed across most of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world, in southern Europe it is rather localized.\r\n	8364729134	2009-02-17 18:33:56
810	Adult birds are black on the head, neck, back and wings, with white underparts. Its population has declined much in recent times: Listed as a species of Least Concern in 1994, it was uplisted to Near Threatened in 2000 and, as it was determined to be less common than previously believed, to Vulnerable in the 2007 IUCN Red List.. The reasons for mortality include illegal shooting, loss of a satisfactory food supply, harassment, predation, and starvation of nestlings during times of low food supply.\r\n	9494014910	2010-03-19 13:43:17
811	Comb Duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos sylvicola) (Ihering & Ihering, 1907) from South America. Both parents brood the young, although the female is more likely to directly tend to the young. Although the brooding mothers, otherwise famous for the high level of their parental care, is fully aware of the sibling aggression, in no raptorial bird species are they known to intervene when cainism occurs.\r\n	1186458772	2009-12-13 19:46:48
812	It leaves the colony as a flock at dusk, with a great deal of screaming and display.. More recently, a review of new data has indicated that this bird should perhaps better be placed into the genus Philomachus - as P. The species has been reported as migrating south from Tibet, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia before crossing the Himalaya.\r\n	2335929518	2009-03-16 12:23:23
813	Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. It is typically 3338 cm (1315 in) long and weighs 190-280g (6.7-10 oz). Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks.\r\n	6959280393	2010-09-25 21:49:51
814	The larger Golden Eagle is apparently dominant and, in at least one case, has killed and consumed a Bonelli s. Whether the morphological distinctness and the non-overlapping ranges, or the genetic similarity are considered to be more significant is presently a matter of opinion, and the taxonomic status of these birds remains equivocal. Bird migration is primarily, but not entirely, a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.\r\n	3466721869	2010-08-23 21:16:57
815	The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The size of the egg is approximately 4132 mm (1.61.3 in). This bird is one of the most common and best-known waders throughout its breeding and wintering ranges, and it is the species with which other waders tend to be compared.\r\n	5694921359	2010-09-12 23:10:41
816	The tail has a black and white barred pattern. The pectinations are shed in the spring. Males often show aggression towards each other, and will partake in ravenous fighting which will leave other males bloodied and otherwise injured.\r\n	3585493246	2010-03-26 20:51:40
817	The California Quail (Callipepla californica), also known as the California Valley Quail or Valley Quail, is a small ground-dwelling bird in the New World quail family. jamaicensis), a related species found as a breeding resident almost throughout North America.

818	In winter, the Long-billed Murrelet lacks the white collar of Marbled.. In areas where Scaled Quail occur without cholla, woody species such as wolfberry (Lycium spp.) and mesquite are important for overhead cover. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex..\r\n	7656461076	2010-12-26 19:19:53
819	The nest is a well-concealed platform built from cattails and other marsh vegetation. The legs and short bill are both dark green.. The muscle medial (underneath) to the pectorals is the supracoracoideus.\r\n	9277535168	2010-10-15 13:16:34
820	Scaled Quail in Oklahoma inhabit rough or rolling land, especially where sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), mesquite, cactus (Opuntia spp. Mallards of all ages (but especially young ones) and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish and felids and canids, including domesticated ones. In 2008, a  Mesora Dinner  was held to reaffirm the kosher status of various species, and Muscovy duck was on the menu.\r\n	8108324440	2009-11-11 23:49:28
821	They assert that Mute Swans are native in the region and therefore deserving of protection. The habit of nesting in groups is believed to provide better survival against predators in several ways. The Christmas Shearwater nests on remote islands of the Central Pacific: the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Tuamotu, the Marshall Islands, Kiritimati (for which the species is named) and Sala-y-Gmez.\r\n	4687846082	2009-08-14 21:40:39
822	Raccoons are the leading predator of nests, and can cause almost complete colony nesting failure when water dries under nests in drought years since they can easily access the nest using dry ground under the tree. The afforement-mentioned  terror bird , Brontornis burmeisteri, has traditionally been classified as a member of this order, although this may not be an accurate classification.. There have also been sightings of Falcated teals in America, Poland and Thailand.\r\n	0357971811	2010-10-19 12:45:21
823	Species hunted have ranged in size from tiny Eurasian Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) and Little Owl (Athene noctua) to the formidable, large Great Horned, Eurasian Eagle and Great Gray Owls (Strix nebulosa). The nail gave the wildfowl family one of its former names:  Unguirostres  comes from the Latin ungus, meaning  nail  and rostrum, meaning  beak .. atratus, named by the German ornithologist Johann Matthus Bechstein in 1793, is known as the North American Black Vulture.\r\n	9675234475	2010-06-25 18:32:16
824	Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world.. Although it has adapted to human settlement in many areas, nest disturbance, continuing changes in land use, and collision with utility lines are still potential problems. Female-female pairing has also been documented and studied in several tern species including Whiskered (Chlidonias hybyida), Roseate (Sterna dougalii) and Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) with similar attributes (supernormal clutches and reduced hatching/fledging success as compared to heterosexual pairs) to same-sex gull pairs.\r\n	8259666630	2010-07-17 13:53:42
825	They do not swim well and stay out of the water. The rhamphotheca grows continuously in most birds and in some species the color varies seasonally. Field identification of the two American Limnodromus remains difficult today.\r\n	6573364285	2009-07-23 15:17:18

828	There are fewer than 1000 breeding pairs of Galapagos Penguins in the world. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. The population in India has however declined.\r\n	6418903509	2009-06-21 20:30:52
829	Biannual surveys conducted by the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) found that between 1998 and 2003 the inter-island coot population averaged 2,100 birds, ranging between 1,500 and 3,000 birds. According to the Smithsonian Migratory Bird. If the chicks are threatened in the nest, they defend themselves by hissing and regurgitating.\r\n	8652122293	2009-12-11 22:39:38
830	Consequently, it was downlisted to Least Concern status in 2008.. One is the Fischer s runaway model, which postulates a positive feedback relationship between female preference for elaborate train and the elaborate train itself. Selenium is an occurring semimetallic trace element that occurs naturally in some soils and minute amounts are necessary for animal life.\r\n	0506003706	2009-09-11 14:37:25
831	In North America, lambs and goats were found to comprise less than 1.4% of all prey items. Among the standard measurements, the wing chord measures 5463 cm (1 ft 9 in2 ft 1 in), the tail measures 3742 cm (1 ft 3 in1 ft 5 in), the tarsus is 11.413 cm (4.55.1 in) long and the exposed culmen from the cere is 4.2 to 6.5 cm (1.7 to 2.6 in)..

832	They face each other and then turn their heads and bills up. They may also elicit shivering as a means of muscular energy consumption to produce heat as needed.. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported.\r\n	2927394332	2010-11-26 21:21:49
833	It nests in the crowns of tall trees, with nest-building in February and March and egg-laying in March and April.. For this reason, it is considered a molluscivore.. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood.\r\n	5639899260	2009-12-11 16:48:47
834	It is 80 cm (31 in) in length and weighs 1,200 g (42 oz).. In China, flax is also used for nest sites. Adolescents return to the colony within 6 years; however they won t start breeding until 11 to 15 years.\r\n	5605414124	2010-05-20 12:47:37
835	However, it is now known that extra-pair copulations (EPCs), extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs), and extra-pair paternity (the raising of anothers offspring, EPP) are actually quite common in a variety of avian orders and families. These may simply reflect a relatively unstable period of population adjustment. The diet of other species, like the Black-browed Albatross or the Grey-headed Albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet.\r\n	7741548018	2010-12-17 21:46:55
836	On the other hand, attempts have been made to establish other breeding populations in captivity.. The female jacana is around twice as big as the male, averaging (145.4g) compared to (86.9g). The population of the eagle declined as a result of forest fragmentation, shooting, and nest destruction, resulting in near extirpation of the species.\r\n	6305642734	2010-01-17 15:38:33
837	They mainly eat vegetation or insects near to the water, consuming animals such as larvae, crustaceans, and mollusks. Although rare, Golden Eagles have been known to use the walk and grab attack to pull a leporid out of its cover. Flocks of over 100 birds are also regularly reported from Gujarat and Australia.\r\n	1758453934	2009-10-27 13:25:14
838	It has a black smudge around the eye, and its underwing pattern varies between individuals, with some having narrower black margins and variable amounts of black in the underwing coverts. This name would apply to the group around its type species (Brandt s Cormorant, P. This is used to deter predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights..\r\n	3166425408	2009-08-11 19:53:51
839	Oscillococcinum is a homeopathic preparation made from Muscovy Duck liver and heart manufactured by the French company Boiron; similar products are also available from other manufacturers. Their breeding habitat is Arctic islands and coastal areas across the northern coasts of Alaska, Canada, and Russia. In a few cases, mankind has accidentally benefited Golden Eagles by logging previously heavily wooded areas.\r\n	4999962193	2009-09-20 19:45:29
840	Hamerstrom (1939) reported sparse vegetation was seldom selected for nesting due to lack of adequate cover. Its wingspan ranges from 62 to 94 cm (24 to 37 in). The population of the Wood Duck was in serious decline in the late 19th century as a result of severe habitat loss and market hunting both for meat and plumage for the ladies  hat market in Europe.\r\n	1071507712	2010-07-11 11:17:50

842	The two mandibles are hinged in such a way that they can be held parallel to hold a row of fish in place and these are also retained by inward-facing serrations on the edges of the beak. Areas dominated by forestry may remain suitable to Hen Harriers provided that a mosaic of age classes is maintained within the forest, such that areas of young, pre-thicket forest are always available.. It is much rarer as a breeding bird, found only in a localised area of the Cairngorms National Park, where 13 pairs have bred since the 1970s.\r\n	3914470462	2009-03-12 21:26:39

844	Also in the order Charadriiformes (family Chionididae), there has been one reported occurrence of a female-female pair in the Black-faced Sheathbill (Chionis minor), but eggs in the clutch proved to be inviable.. Snow Geese often travel and feed alongside Greater White-fronted Geese; in contrast, the two tend to avoid travelling and feeding alongside Canada Geese, which are often heavier birds.. Some nest linings, such as the shell fragments in this Charadrius plover scrape, may help to prevent the eggs from sinking into muddy or sandy soil.\r\n	6565891865	2009-09-18 11:40:10
845	The Red-necked Grebe has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies P. Black-shouldered Kites live almost exclusively on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. Surprisingly, individuals prefer to eat on their own instead of with their hunting group, usually in the early morning or late afternoon.\r\n	9255046627	2010-04-23 14:25:15

Predation can be heightened during migration: the Eleonora s Falcon, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. In places devoid of trees (like Central Asian mountains), they use holes in cliffs and steep, high banks, sometimes at considerable distances from the water.\r\n	3676668330	2009-05-12 19:19:54

The Western Gull is rarely encountered inland or away from the ocean and is almost an exclusively marine gull. Like all cormorants, this includes stretching the gular sac with the hyoid bone and repeated  yawning ; as in many but not all cormorants, the Pelagic Cormorant s display furthermore includes arching the neck and hopping, lifting the folded wings and rapidly fluttering them to show the white thigh patches. It is normally connected with either death or as a bird of prey.\r\n	0797304577	2009-06-12 21:36:11
957	Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with the mass of the adult bird. Incubation times are long compared to other birds, as are fledgling periods. They eat cicada, grasshoppers, and other crop-damaging insects, making them economically important. It has a short bill, bright pink in the middle with a black base and tip, and pink feet.\r\n	8967627451	2010-08-21 10:32:11

Although many young guineafowl manage to fall down drains (and are left behind by the flock), it is not enough to restrain their numbers. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6 times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. While it cannot be completely excluded that early specimens were collected on another island, only O?ahu and Kaua?i seem possible given the history of the specimens  collection, and only on the latter island is a similar-sized species now known to have once existed.\r\n	4720751005	2010-06-25 22:39:23
960	The Black-breasted Wood Quail (Odontophorus leucolaemus) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. Twelve out of sixteen dietary studies in North America showed leporids as the most common prey group, in some areas comprising over 75% of prey remains. Larger; flanks lighter (light grey, in females sometimes whitish). Bi-parental care is given and the young are considered altricial.\r\n	3543704565	2009-11-17 18:42:43

962	It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.. It lays one egg on a thick lichen- or moss-covered branch or hollow. This is evidenced by other names suggesting the species came from lands where it is not actually native, but from where much  outlandish  produce was imported at that time (see below).. The breeding male is patterned grey, with a black rear end, light chestnut wings, and a brilliant white speculum, obvious in flight or at rest.\r\n	0848147542	2010-12-14 23:36:12
963	The species, once widespread in the West Indies, is now far less common.

968	Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately 30 metres apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. Mallards frequently interbreed with their closest relatives in the genus Anas, such as the American Black Duck, and also with species more distantly related, for example the Northern Pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their bills. Gathering peewit eggs is prohibited by the European Union, but Friesland was granted an exception for cultural-historical reasons.\r\n	0003058336	2010-04-24 22:23:38
969	The most important breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway has expanded to the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. This is a fairly quiet species; the male has a hoarse whistling call, and the female has a Mallard-like quack. Like almost all raptors, the Red-shouldered Hawk is monogamous and territorial. On the other hand, attempts have been made to establish other breeding populations in captivity..\r\n	6618710395	2009-09-12 11:57:19
970	In New Mexico, it was not unusual to find Scaled Quail 10 to 15 miles (1624 km) from water. It lacks a syrinx, so therefore its vocalizations are limited to grunts or low hisses.. Adult males have a rust-red body, a blue bill, and a white face with a black cap. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food.\r\n	1853886488	2009-06-13 11:52:39
971	It is the North American counterpart and a close relative of the Whooper Swan of Eurasia, and even has been considered the same species by some authorities.. The underside is bright white; on the head the upperside s grey extends town to eye height and the white cheeks may shine up conspicuously, as in the smaller shearwaters of Puffinus sensu stricto. The breeding female is predominantly dark brown and black above, with red underparts and white cheek patches. These birds feed mainly by diving, but they will dabble.\r\n	9918725339	2010-07-12 18:20:48

Like cormorants but unlike other birds, darters use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.. Scandinavian and Russian birds also migrate southwards, but western European birds, and a few in Japan, are largely resident.\r\n	9988631581	2010-02-24 17:44:18
976	It cannot be confused with any other duck in its range.. Incubation lasts from 2125 days, usually performed by the female and rarely by the male. In the nominate subspecies, males average 3.2 kg (7.1 lb) and females average 2.84 kg (6.3 lb). Foxes may prey on the same species in a given area but, as they are occasionally hunted by the eagles and are mainly nocturnal, they tend to avoid direct conflicts.\r\n	9869303676	2009-07-19 20:55:26
977	brachyurus is a year-round resident except that most of the Florida population migrates in winter to the southern tip of the state, including the Keys. The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures. The female, or  reeve , is 2226 cm (8.710.2 in) long with a 4649 cm (18.119.32 in) wingspan, and weighs about 110 g (3.9 oz). Megapode chicks have an egg tooth while still in the egg but lose it before hatching, while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way out.\r\n	5044511944	2010-10-18 19:51:54
978	It is possible that the Red-necked Grebe originally evolved in North America and later spread to Europe, where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin. The strong bill is flesh-toned, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Three species, the Black-headed Heron, Whistling Heron and especially the Cattle Egret are less tied to watery environments and may feed far away from water.

The migration of geese is an example of the annual, large-scale movement of birds between their breeding (summer) homes and their nonbreeding (winter) grounds.. The Toco Toucan, which has the largest beak relative to the size of its body of any bird species, is capable of modifying the blood flow to its beak. Like all cormorants, the Rock Shag feeds by diving for underwater prey.\r\n	6948852761	2010-05-24 13:58:14
980	Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animal species; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species culturally transmit knowledge across generations.. The head is dark brown with a bald, black face, and the thick downcurved bill is dusky yellow. There is some evidence that increased vulnerability may lead some burrow-nesting species to form colonies, or to nest closer to rival pairs in areas of high predation than they might otherwise do.. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey..\r\n	1567778928	2010-05-25 17:22:44
981	They search for food only during the day and normally within a few kilometers of their breeding site. Its glyph is easily distinguishable by the knob on the birds beak and by the concentric circles that make up the birds eyes. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. The Wood Duck is a medium-sized perching duck.\r\n	5684695517	2010-10-23 17:15:42
982	Birds of the nominate subspecies (no matter which taxonomic arrangement is preferred) are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe; individuals from the Pacific coast of North America may similarly stray as far as Hawaii.. It will often make its presence known, however, with its distinctive ki-ki-krr call or an aggressive, presumably territorial, growl. Some populations undergo an extensive molt migration while others remain on or near breeding grounds. The consensus view in contemporary paleontology is that the birds, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids.\r\n	1101086854	2009-11-14 11:24:16
983	Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Adults undergo a complete moult after breeding, which is normally finished by late August or early September, before migration to south eastern Africa. Nest success of protected nests was significantly higher than that of unprotected nests, and positive population-level impacts were apparent. The forehead and lores are blackish with a bare red crown and a white streak extending from behind the eyes to the upper back.\r\n	4155168978	2010-08-16 16:15:36
984	The Hawaiian Duck (Anas wyvilliana) is a species of bird in the family Anatidae. Large numbers can often be seen swirling in synchronized flight on stop-overs during migration or on their winter habitat.. In early fall the male will have a white crescent on each side of the face. These birds forage in soft mud with some vegetation, mainly picking up food by sight.\r\n	8349890592	2009-09-15 17:22:49
985	They alternate groups of stiff, shallow wingbeats with glides.. The gonys is the ventral ridge of the lower mandible, created by the junction of the bone s two rami, or lateral plates. Prairie dogs, one of the favorite foods of the Ferruginous Hawk. Adults are about 19 inches (480 mm) in length..\r\n	7564902166	2010-11-25 19:46:18
986	However, where afforestation takes place in areas that were previously underutilised by Hen Harriers, it may increase the value of such areas to this species in the long-term (Wilson et al. Females lay 7 to 15 yellowish-white eggs. Having a largely vegetarian diet, most wigeon migrate in the fall well before northern marshes begin to freeze.. It is highly gregarious, forming large flocks when not breeding, and is largely resident apart from local movements.\r\n	2718454385	2010-01-15 21:40:55
987	Six extant and one extinct subspecies of Sharp-tailed Grouse have been described:. In the United States, many studies of the effects of industrialization and development have been undertaken by the very companies attempting to develop near areas holding Golden Eagles, in order to understand and hopefully minimize harmful effects. Like all eagles, it is in the family Accipitridae. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head.\r\n	2345862622	2010-07-17 13:54:25
988	The Great Shearwater feeds on fish and squid, which it catches from the surface or by plunge-diving. Booted eagles have legs and feet feathered to the toes and build very large stick nests.. The fledglings stay with their parents for the first winter migration. These birds forage on ground or water, picking up food by sight.\r\n	8154064146	2009-04-18 21:16:15
989	Adult females are less colourful, with brownish-grey plumage and a white patch on the head around the eye. In 1983 only 32 individuals were left, of which the largest part were hybrids with the Pied-billed Grebe. hudsonius (Linnaeus, 1766) breeds in North America and is sometimes considered a distinct species, C. The young is duller with smaller horn, and has brown tail and wings..\r\n	3871756010	2009-08-25 18:35:34

990	They themselves may fall prey to various hawks, owls and eagles, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by bears (Ursus spp.), various weasels (Mustela spp.), mink (Mustela vison), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and even Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus husonicus).. This harrier tends to be a very vocal bird while it glides over its hunting ground.. These introduced animals depredated and altered the nesting colonies, leading to assessment of the petrel as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It winters on both coasts, from the mid-Atlantic states south to at least Brazil on the Atlantic, and from Oregon south to Peru and Chile on the Pacific..\r\n	4647212434	2009-07-19 12:20:29
991	These birds display in open areas known as leks with other males, anywhere from a single male to upwards of 20 will occupy one lek (averaging 8-12). Northern Shovelers feed by dabbling for plant food, often by swinging its bill from side to side and using the bill to strain food from the water. In warmer locations, some are permanent residents; others migrate to Central America and the West Indies. AKS (t= 300 000 years) and DL (t=258 000 years) indicate that these populations.\r\n	2569992806	2010-05-28 14:55:43
992	Sometimes a bird such as an Arctic Skua will harass a Puffin arriving with a beakful of fish, causing it to drop its catch. Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, the Mottled Duck is one of the most frequently banded waterfowl. The bird was also assigned to the genus Gyparchus by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since Sarcoramphus has priority as the earlier name. The name of venerable Shariputra, one of the Buddha s best known followers, signifies the son of the egret (among other possibilities), it is said that his mother had eyes like a great egret..\r\n	5817215731	2010-06-14 12:48:36
993	In winter plumage, the general appearance recalls a tiny version of Common Sandpiper. The underparts are white and the outer edges of the wings are black. The well-documented records come from the United States of America, but this probably reflects the fact that such birds are more commonly reported by birders there, rather than a geographical variation. Parental roles are not well known, but it is believed the female departs and leaves the male to tend the chicks, which find all their own food..\r\n	5355917479	2010-05-26 17:35:45
994	In 2009, a collision with a flock of migratory Canada Geese resulted in US Airways Flight 1549 suffering a total power loss after takeoff. As a result of its wingspan, it is capable of remaining in the air without flapping its wings for several hours at a time (travelling 22 m for every metre of drop). It breeds in northern Canada and Alaska in a variety of tundra habitats. The forehead is dark brown and the cheeks and throat are black streaked with white..\r\n	5195036167	2010-07-22 21:15:14
995	Despite the dramatic ways in which they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of Golden Eagles is often rather uneventful. More recent research has found a neural connection between the eye and  Cluster N , the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually be able to see the magnetic field of the earth.. In flight the greenish yellow flight feathers are obvious. In Japan, a pair was seen mating 46 days before egg laying and in the United States 55 days after egg-laying.\r\n	1372447354	2009-05-15 18:15:40
996	The Great Egret is generally a very successful species with a large and expanding range. Sexes are similar, but immature birds have white-streaked grey upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts. In the ensuing violent battle, the wildcat mother and the eagle both died. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended and the duckling is now a juvenile.\r\n	2499572943	2010-02-16 20:15:19
997	The Banded Quail is endemic to western central Mexico where its main habitat is dry scrubby countryside with shrubs but it also sometimes moves onto cultivated land and pasture. Adult males have a yellow comb over their eyes and a violet display patch on their neck. The Buff-necked Ibis lives in a wide range of open habitats, including fields, marshes, savanna and grassland. Hens typically lay about nine eggs.\r\n	5729478377	2010-07-15 12:37:42
998	The Harpy Eagle inhabits tropical lowland rainforests and may occur within such areas from the canopy to the emergent vegetation. Wandering Albatrosses spend most of their life in flight, landing only to breed and feed. It also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga, on coasts, or where created by fire. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.\r\n	2313442168	2010-07-22 16:19:21
999	The Booted is a small eagle, comparable to the Common Buzzard in size though more eagle-like in shape. On the conservation front, the Golden Eagle is itself unintentionally contributing to the conservation crisis of another animal, the Island Fox, a small insular relative of the Gray Fox found only in the Channel Islands of California. It is native to much of Europe and Asia, and (as a rare winter visitor) the far north of Africa.  Cormorant  is a contraction derived either directly from Latin corvus marinus,  sea raven  or through Brythonic Celtic.\r\n	8982971801	2009-02-17 11:14:37

1001	Some in South America breed even later than thatBlack Vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February. Although subordinate chicks beg just as much as their dominant brothers, the older chicks are able to divert the parents  attention to themselves, as their large size and conspicuousness serve as more effective stimuli..\r\n	3944985696	2009-08-12 18:13:58
1002	Juveniles are more heavily barred above and have buff edges to the wing feathers.. Other European colonies are found in the south west of Ireland, and off the west (Runde Island) and north of Norway (Syltefjord, Hovflesa and Storstappen).\r\n	2859353240	2009-07-19 22:36:53
1003	The range of the wild form stretches from Tamil Nadu, South India (where it has almost certainly been diluted with cross breeding from domestic breeds) eastwards across southern China and into Malaysia, the Philippines (where it is locally known as labuyo) and Indonesia. It occurs on waters with some salinity, such as brackish lakes, estuaries and mangrove swamps.\r\n	3895375423	2010-05-26 20:13:33
1004	The English names refer to the habit of the species of nesting in dry hay or cereal fields, rather than the marshes used by most members of this family.. In marshes, sloughs, and ponds, Green-winged Teal select the seeds of bulrushes, pondweeds, and spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.).\r\n	8455162315	2010-04-21 21:22:18

1021	The bill is short with a sharp, hooked tip to the upper mandible. Song learning in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile listening to the father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template.\r\n	5648841062	2009-03-19 19:54:57
1022	Although the brooding mothers, otherwise famous for the high level of their parental care, is fully aware of the sibling aggression, in no raptorial bird species are they known to intervene when cainism occurs. It is threatened primarily by habitat loss provoked by the expansion of logging, cattle ranching, agriculture and prospecting.\r\n	3395578825	2009-11-22 10:11:20

The molecular evidence suggests that the storm-petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. However, anthropogenic factors (e.g.\r\n	6584472224	2010-07-25 14:27:26
1141	Among standard measurements, the wing bone is 2835 cm (1114 in) long, the tail is 1624 cm (6.39.4 in) long and the tarsus is 7.59 cm (3.03.5 in). Future studies must emphasize the economic importance of cracids to produce results that are. Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species.\r\n	2835436920	2009-12-17 15:24:25
1142	Hunting success is apparently relatively low. Yet, as demand for water increases. They are 1723 cm long, but the females are larger than the males.\r\n	6240498264	2010-03-20 18:40:38
1143	Japanese quail eggs have orbited the Earth in several Soviet and Russian spacecraft, including the Bion 5 satellite and the Salyut 6 and Mir space stations. These birds feed mainly by diving or dabbling. It nests in colonies, often with other herons, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs.\r\n	4509980373	2009-02-13 14:19:12
1144	This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and skuas, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below 100 m (330 ft), although has nested at up to 1,800 m (5,900 ft) in Turkey.. In Florida, American Crows have been known to consume eggs of this species..\r\n	1270118012	2009-02-18 19:21:50
1145	The oldest known individual reached an age of over 18 years.. The adult male chin, cheeks and upper region all bright metallic green with gold overtones, with a bluish tinge on the chin, forehead and tail and purple copper on the back, The lower part of the throat is white and the rest of the lower region is deep rufous, ferruginso. The sexes are similar, although the male is larger, with a proportionally longer bill and neck; in fact the largest females are barely as large as the smallest males.\r\n	1169889109	2010-05-13 20:57:25
1146	Ring-necked Ducks are small to medium sized diving ducks. Although more adapatable in habitat than the Sharp-shinned Hawk, studies have indicated that the species still more often than not prefers sizeable tracts of woodland for breeding and migrating to fragmented, developed areas.. The adult female averages about 900 g (2.0 lb) and 44 cm (17 in) in length, while the adult male is on average 1,050 g (2.31 lb) and 48 cm (19 in) in length, making this the smallest species of scoter on average.\r\n	3903422239	2010-08-21 11:11:13
1147	Ruffs of both sexes have an additional moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the Bar-tailed Godwit. In adult birds, the plumage of both subspecies is entirely white, with black feet, and a bill that is mostly black, with a thin salmon-pink streak running along the mouthline and  depending on the subspecies  more or less yellow in the proximal part. One of the most interesting things about this bird is the melanistic  black  phase  this species occurs in two colour morphs, with no intermediates.\r\n	8143111973	2010-12-12 21:56:15
1148	Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair s territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. More pairs of eyes and ears are available to raise the alarm and rise to the occasion..\r\n	0442819850	2010-06-25 17:20:33
1149	This species moults gradually beginning in March or April until September or October each year. During the second year of their lives, Canada Geese find a mate. Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song.\r\n	3347995696	2009-07-24 20:49:48
1150	americana (Black Scoter) is sometimes considered a subspecies of M. There are three subspecies with slight variations in appearance:. The clutch is 2-4 brown-marked white eggs, incubated mainly by the female for 3435 days to hatching, with a further 5 weeks to fledging.\r\n	0296319434	2010-03-18 10:23:56
1151	However, mates can wait up to 38 days to be relieved, and if something happens to the mate the other has been recorded incubating for 49 days without food or water.. One well-studied case of this phenomenon has been the effect on Common Murre colonies on islands in Alaska, where foxes were introduced for fur farming.. Like other New World vultures, the Turkey Vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80..\r\n	4131287372	2010-02-14 21:26:27
1152	The meals are composed of both fresh squid, fish and krill, as well as stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. The average life expectancy of Golden Eagles in Germany is 13 years, extrapolated from a reported mere 92.5% survival rate.. The Crested Eagle has a large head, an effect enhanced by the often extended feather crest of its name.\r\n	5800959257	2010-08-21 17:30:47
1153	Finally in the Indian Ocean it breeds on the Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, and McDonald Island. The nest is unconcealed and conspicuous, being visible from afar. In summer they can be found near rich understory of blueberries and other shrub, and in winter they prefer denser stands..\r\n	3591184109	2009-03-22 18:43:22
1154	The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order, Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes. Both sexes have a bare red face and greyish legs (the latter separating it from the red-legged Silver Pheasant). Their preferred habitat is open grasslands with scattered trees and they are often seen hunting along roadsides.\r\n	2695912940	2009-07-13 18:49:39
1155	The Corn Crake is mainly a lowland species, but breeds up to 1,400 m (4,600 ft) altitude in the Alps, 2,700 m (8,600 ft) in China and 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in Russia. conditions in the small swath of the Andes in which it. However, the two species can be differentiated by their tails and bills.\r\n	2709976551	2010-05-13 20:49:16
1156	Distributed across most of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world, in southern Europe it is rather localized. Manske and Barker (1987) reported sun sedge (Carex inops), needle and thread grass (Hesperostipa comata), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) on lekking grounds in the Sheyenne National Grassland in North Dakota. The primary bronchi, or the mesobronchi, deliver the air to the posterior sacs at the caudal end of the bird.\r\n	6984212168	2010-12-22 22:11:16
1157	The male s  song  is a loud croaking.. In some areas, though, the breeding success rate is considerably greater and, occasionally, all cygnets may reach maturity. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) of Washington State has created aquatic reserves surrounding Smith and Minor Islands.\r\n	6187805992	2009-12-21 22:56:58
1158	Birds of the nominate subspecies (no matter which taxonomic arrangement is preferred) are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe; individuals from the Pacific coast of North America may similarly stray as far as Hawaii.. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.. ! is corresponds to the fi rst extensive Pleistocene glaciation in the.\r\n	1937507101	2010-03-24 14:24:49
1369	A common pattern in North America is clockwise migration, where birds flying North tend to be further West, and flying South tend to shift Eastwards..\r\n	2316494979	2009-10-27 20:18:33
1159	While on the water, wigeon often gather with feeding coots and divers, and are known to grab pieces of vegetation brought to the surface by diving water birds. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an egg tooth, which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg, and that falls off once it has done its job.. This species often overlaps in range with the less scarce Harpy Eagle, which is likely its close relative and is somewhat similar to appearance.\r\n	1658871205	2010-11-23 21:12:51
1160	The juvenile is duller overall, with little or no white on the upperwing. This small population of genetically unique Magnificent Frigatebirds is a vulnerable population. As with the mammalian larynx, sound is produced by the vibration of air flowing across the organ.\r\n	5973723747	2009-10-27 11:47:24
1161	One of the best places to view the hawk is in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) in Idaho. In North Dakota, radio-tagged juvenile Golden Eagles stayed within 5 km (3.1 mi) of the nest for the first 100 days after fledging but then dispersed over 15 km (9.3 mi) in the following 40 days. Occasionally the birds form homosexual pairs consisting of two females.\r\n	8968982296	2010-11-17 23:47:19
1162	In places devoid of trees (like Central Asian mountains), they use holes in cliffs and steep, high banks, sometimes at considerable distances from the water. Most species of birds have external nares (nostrils) located somewhere on their beak. Occasionally, both harriers and Short-eared Owls will harass each other until the victim drops its prey and it can be stolen, a practice known as kleptoparasitism.\r\n	0487463550	2009-03-16 20:15:37
1163	As predicted by the flight capacity of the species, the authors found signatures of high gene flow across most of the distribution range. The downy juvenile birds leave the nest soon after hatching. Kunlunshan with the exception of H4, H6, H12 and H17 constructed the clade B.\r\n	0186213687	2010-09-20 22:40:57
1164	If the nest is abandoned or destroyed, the female may lay a replacement clutch. These lakes can be very close to the breeding grounds, or miles away. A single egg is laid in a large nest, typically built on steep slopes or cliffs with tussock grass, and incubated for 72 days.\r\n	0250856628	2009-11-18 11:50:28
1165	It breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. For most seabirds if breeding is successful they will continue breeding with the same partner year after year until one member of the pair dies or doesnt return to the breeding colony. These birds stand still at the water s edge and wait to ambush prey, but are easier to see than many small heron species.\r\n	0616396983	2010-10-16 17:11:16
1166	The ground nest is made of sticks, reeds and grasses. Both sexes dance, and immature birds join the adults. Selenium is an occurring semimetallic trace element that occurs naturally in some soils and minute amounts are necessary for animal life.\r\n	1132743788	2010-02-28 22:30:58
1167	In captivity, birds breed only after their fifth year. Two Whooping Crane chicks were hatched from one nest, on June 22, 2006. The nervous system is large relative to the bird s size.\r\n	3048259437	2010-02-23 13:33:13
1168	Their underparts are light brown with a few fine black shaft streaks and other lines. It is migratory, wintering mainly in the Aleutian Islands.. A similar strategy is adopted by the Greater Noctule bat, which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants.\r\n	8628066112	2009-03-14 15:24:51
1169	The Black-footed Albatross has an occurrence range of 37,600,000 km2 (14,500,000 sq mi) and a breeding range of 28 km2 (11 sq mi), with a population of 129,000 adult birds. No other relationships beyond that group were implied. their populations are easily censused, they can be used effectively (along with several other bird.\r\n	0977894302	2009-04-25 11:44:16
1170	Both hypotheses seem rather spurious initially, with the GWT and Common Teal s male nuptial plumage being unique and very complex, and the tendency to gain, not lose, strong sexual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabbling ducks. In such places, scrapes are shallower and tend to be lined with non-vegetative material (including shells, feathers, sticks and soil), which allows convective cooling to occur as air moves over the eggs. They are fond of dust-bathing and at dusk, groups walk in single file to a favourite waterhole to drink.\r\n	5282229766	2009-08-24 20:34:45
1171	While they share some habitat with Horned Puffins (F. Main causes of death are predation by the endangered Lord Howe Rail and flooding of burrows. The bird was also assigned to the genus Gyparchus by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since Sarcoramphus has priority as the earlier name.\r\n	5503224217	2010-07-21 17:35:43
1172	Islands where terrestrial predators have arrived in the form of rats, cats, foxes, etc., have devastated island seabird colonies. It mostly moves by paddling along efficiently with its webbed feet and seldom takes to the air. Thus, the partial pressure of oxygen in a bird s respiratory tract is the same as the environment, and so birds have more efficient gas exchange than mammals do..\r\n	8634429071	2010-02-23 20:17:56
1173	Having thus in process of time been clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they either fall into the water or fly freely away into the air. The Crab Plover also uses a burrow nest, the warmth of which allows it to leave the eggs unattended for as long as 58 hours.. Many Buller s Albatrosses and Black-footed Albatrosses nest under trees in open forest.\r\n	8609972125	2009-02-18 15:19:58
1174	These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by Golden Eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed Golden Eagle nests. George Robert Gray noted that it matched a bird illustrated (plate 76) in Jardine and Selby s  Illustrations of Ornithology  which he noted should be called as Tetraogallus caucasicus and another illustration plate 141 which was said to be the male of the one in plate 76 was separated based on the geography and given the name of Tetraogallus himalayensis.\r\n	9967043136	2009-08-10 22:10:14
1175	Egg-laying typically occurs from April to August. It has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). The standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of 5272 cm (2028 in), a tail length of 26.538 cm (10.415.0 in) and a tarsus length of 9.412.2 cm (3.74.8 in).\r\n	8092002448	2009-05-10 20:36:45
1176	The summer adult s body is white apart from the dark grey back and wings and black head. Sarus Crane abundance was positively associated with percentage of wetlands on the landscape, and negatively with the percentage of area under rice cultivation.. During the past two years, five of the approximately 100 Whooping Cranes in the Eastern population have been illegally shot and killed.\r\n	2050931966	2009-09-18 12:52:19
1177	The latter species competes with the similarly sized Amazonian Umbrellabird (Cephalopterus ornatus) as the largest passerine in South America.. It was reported that these hybrid birds have joined courting parties of Eurasian Widgeon and even attempted to compete with Widgeon males. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking.\r\n	3929403851	2010-11-13 13:36:48

The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but are still not fully genetically incompatible.\r\n	0827075411	2009-02-24 19:57:44
1180	The Laysan Albatross has a wide range across the North Pacific, with 16 nesting sites. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. Females also make a noise like trrr.\r\n	2151407994	2009-04-15 19:22:41
1181	They have a brown cap, a white forehead, a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill.. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. The numbers of this species (and of Curlew Sandpiper) depend on the population of lemmings.\r\n	4881709832	2009-12-24 16:20:16
1182	Toxic chemicals have not been suggested as a significant threat to the Ferruginous Hawk. Consequently, some people reject this definition of a species.. Moreover, the DOI officials stated that the current federal budget for the nations wildlife refuge system would be insufficient to prevent the continued ingestion of lead paint by Laysan chicks..\r\n	0436510934	2010-04-15 10:16:32
1183	The goal of the recovery program is to conserve and recover the species to the extent that it may be down-listed from endangered to threatened in the near future, and ultimately, that the population be healthy enough to no longer require federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. of habitat conditions required by specialized bird. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different.\r\n	8472480681	2010-01-28 10:43:31
1184	It has been suggested that in coastal waters this species prefers sheltered embayments, and possibly waters that include some mixed depths.. Slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even elephant bird, rhinoceros egret.\r\n	4559403622	2009-03-25 13:47:27
1185	Like all accipiters, the Tiny Hawk feeds primarily on birds. The females and immature males are grey birds with chestnut foreheads and crowns, and can be confused at a distance with the Ruddy Duck; they are often known as  redhead  Smew. Most were found in the northwestern Gyeonggi Bay, which also holds most of South Korea s breeding birds, but significant counts were made at several more southern sites, especially in the second survey circuit..\r\n	0982265696	2010-12-25 20:53:57
1186	Experiments have shown that asynchronous hatching may also reduce sibling rivalry. These areas are good areas to walk during this time to flush birds. This is especially true in the contiguous Western United States outside of Washington state and coastal California where they often register as second, third or even fourth most represented family by remains.\r\n	7077756882	2009-05-21 23:33:33
1187	For example, when Robert Ridgway discussed the Short-tailed Hawk collected at Oyster Bay, Lee County, Florida by W. There is some post-breeding dispersal to well north of the nesting range.. This is unusual in a long-distance migrant.\r\n	6842202936	2010-02-16 21:24:22
1188	In Oklahoma, 66% of nests were in one of four situations: (1) dead Russian-thistle, (2) machinery and junk, (3) mixed forbs, and (4) soapweed yucca. The Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture flies solitarily, with wings held in a dihedral position. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if the latter prey item are found in great abundance.\r\n	8206691596	2009-05-16 11:45:33
1189	In fact, all Aquila eagles in Eurasia face the same human-sourced threats as the Golden Eagle: habitat change, persecution, poisoning (often directed at other species) and collisions with man-made objects. is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. They themselves may fall prey to various hawks, owls and eagles, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by bears (Ursus spp.), various weasels (Mustela spp.), mink (Mustela vison), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and even Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus husonicus)..\r\n	0508722389	2009-05-19 16:43:37
1190	The Osprey is particularly well adapted to this diet, with reversible outer toes, sharp spicules on the underside of the toes, closable nostrils to keep out water during dives, and backwards-facing scales on the talons which act as barbs to help hold its catch.. They elaborate that a best case scenario puts it at a 17% increase and a worst case scenario of a 7.2% reduction.. This problem is also evident for the pink-footed goose..\r\n	8049685886	2010-10-25 11:54:12
1191	The main threat to the species, and the primary reason for its decline in the Western Palearctic, comes from habitat loss and degradation, as a result of dam construction, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, and drainage of wetlands. Since the 1960s, the interannual population size has fluctuated from less than 1,000 birds to over 3,000, and appears to be gradually increasing. Aristotle used the words genus and species to mean generic and specific categories.\r\n	9359385052	2009-08-14 14:23:21
1192	Although adult Willow Ptarmigans are vegetarians, the newly hatched young also feed on insects. The upperparts are a deep, glossy brown, while the breast is white and sometimes streaked with brown, and the underparts are pure white. While nesting, the female will turn to face the sun throughout the day, so the nest is surrounded by excretion..\r\n	8001278437	2010-01-17 20:15:27
1193	 The 3 of Birds  by the Master of the Playing Cards, 15th-century Germany. The American Wigeon is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks.. In captivity, Sarus Cranes have been known to live for as long as 42 years.[note 3] Premature adult mortality is often the result of human actions.\r\n	4935258260	2009-01-27 19:26:19
1194	These areas are good areas to walk during this time to flush birds. The juvenile has a white head and all black bill. The Zone-tailed is comparable in length and wingspan to common large Buteos found to the north such as Swainson s and Red-tailed Hawk, but may weigh considerably less.\r\n	9195647301	2010-05-11 20:58:56
1195	The Pelagic Cormorant breeds on rocky shores and islands. The population is increasing at a rate of more than 5% per year. It is one of the smallest alcids, only the closely related Least Auklet being smaller.\r\n	0341390024	2009-10-15 22:53:52
1196	Females are slightly larger at 47 to 61 cm (19 to 24 in) in length and a mean weight of 700 g (1.5 lb). Based on mtDNA, it was recently confirmed that lineata and crawfurdi should be regarded as subspecies of the Kalij Pheasant.. This species is smaller than the Common Eider.\r\n	0156908518	2010-09-16 22:38:52
1214	Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. Its legs and bill are also black.  Mallard  is derived from the Old French malart or mallart  wild drake , although its ultimate derivation is unclear.\r\n	9699414575	2010-08-19 13:59:15
1197	When ducklings mature into flight-capable juveniles, they learn about and remember their traditional migratory routes (unless they are born and raised in captivity). The back and wings are scalloped with shades of golden brown with sub-terminal tawny-buff bands and pale edges. The Fulvous Whistling Duck is listed as being of  Least Concern  by the IUCN as it is estimated to have a total population size of 1.3 to 1.5 million individuals.\r\n	3492301140	2009-10-21 16:38:56
1198	This bird was also known as the  White Crow  by the Spanish in Paraguay. They breed in the tundra and the boreal forest; it is estimated that 75% of the North American population breed in Alaska. There is a suggestion that across these species, the bill tip organ is more well developed among species foraging in wet habitats (water column or soft mud) than in species using a more terrestrial foraging.\r\n	3246944281	2010-11-20 17:18:46

1200	A large pelican can attain a wingspan of 3.6 m (11.8 ft), second only to the great albatrosses among all living birds.. The rump is white and the tail black. They also walk with difficulty and this means that they have difficulty taking off from a flat area.\r\n	9479118442	2010-03-17 11:32:54
1201	They perform elaborate greeting rituals, and area also spectacular divers, plunging into the ocean at high speed. The Mallard is a medium-sized waterfowl species although is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks. They are graceful in flight, more like terns..\r\n	8176825463	2010-08-23 17:52:53
1202	Other non-vocal sounds include soft drumming by territorial males (a sound produced by the beating wings) and a tail-swish and a whoosh produced by the tail feathers in flight.. Here the mountain ranges are relatively moderate and consistent, thus being reliable for thermals and updrafts which made long-distance migrating feasible. If discovered while perched, they are relatively easy to shoot, since they usually perch for extended periods of time..\r\n	6920272178	2009-11-17 13:17:49
1203	Breeding occurs year round with a peak in November and December. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering Ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to Brown Pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall.\r\n	4988781449	2010-09-11 23:51:46
1204	This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.. Golden Eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho. Unfortunately after the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, the lake bed fractured.\r\n	9194728409	2009-11-17 14:16:24
1205	The traditionally classified genus can be broken down into two groups: facultative cainists (wherein fewer than 90% of known nests do the oldest nestling attack and kill their younger siblings) and obligate cainists (wherein more than 90% of nests do the older kill the younger siblings). The Black-browed Albatross is a medium-sized albatross, at 8095 cm (3137 in) long with a 200240 cm (7994 in) wingspan and an average weight of 2.94.7 kg (6.410.4 lb). The Golden Eagle is a powerful hunter with few avian rivals in size or strength, although what it gains in these areas it loses somewhat in its agility and speed.\r\n	7408548067	2010-10-24 23:49:25
1206	This allows them to penetrate 35 m (1016 ft) below the surface, and occasionally they will swim down to 1215 m (4050 ft).. Chaucer (13431400) used the word to refer to a proud and ostentatious person in his simile  proud a pekok  in Troilus and Criseyde (Book I, line 210).. Several species of feather mites, helminth and blood parasites have been described from the species..\r\n	5348154944	2010-07-26 23:20:56
1207	The call is a high-pitched whee-oo whee-oo.. fuligula), yielding offspring that have a small nape crest unlike any European Aythya species. The eagle is most common in Brazil, where it is found across the entire national territory.\r\n	2612522880	2009-06-26 23:42:36
1208	They felt the genetic evidence meant it was equally valid to consider all six to be classified within the genus Platalea or alternatively the two placed in the monotypic genera Platibis and Ajaja, respectively. The head is white with a dark mask across the eyes, reaching to the sides of the neck. The mantle and scapulars of flavirostris have narrow, indistinct pale fringes creating a uniform appearance to the birds  upperparts, whereas albifrons has noticeable whitish fringes creating obviously barred upperparts.\r\n	8070018198	2009-09-13 12:25:41
1209	The fossil record of the albatrosses in the northern hemisphere is more complete than that of the southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The male usually passes off food to the female, which she then feeds to the young, although later the female will capture food and simply drop into the nest for her nestlings to eat. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes anywhere between 140 and 170 days.\r\n	4300360870	2010-08-21 20:40:37
1210	The Sulae are also united by their characteristic display behavior, which agrees with the phylogeny as laid out by anatomical and DNA sequence data. It has rounded wings and a crest. This species also may be perceived as a threat by farmers due to the similar Black Vulture s tendency to attack and kill newborn cattle.\r\n	2217522468	2010-09-22 22:33:33
1211	In Idaho, 100% of observed nests produced at least one fledgling when the jackrabbits peaked in the late 1970s through the early 1980s and then at the low point in the mid to late 1980s, the nests produced on average only 0.2 fledglings. It is believed that Snail Kites turn to these alternatives only when apple snails become scarce, such as during drought, but further study is needed. It is now considered either to be a separate species, Fulica alai, or a subspecies of the American Coot, Fulica americana alai..\r\n	9923117288	2010-11-26 21:37:34
1212	Widespread throughout its large range, the Lady Amherst s Pheasant is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.. In the Llanos, where American White Ibis coexist with the Scarlet Ibis, their diets differ, the former consuming more bugs, fish and crustaceans, while the latter eat a much higher proportion of beetles. Much of the North American hunting is done by groups of hunters with flushing dogs such as Labrador Retrievers and Springer Spaniels walking through fields and shooting the birds as they take flight.\r\n	4066064662	2009-07-20 13:19:50
1213	Both names refer to the male s striking white/black piebald coloration. The female lays three to six pale blue eggs. It is white below, unlike other north Atlantic petrels, and has a white face with a black eye mask like a phalarope.\r\n	6758288624	2010-08-11 20:27:43

The specific epithet of nigripes is derived from two Latin words, niger means black, and pes means foot...\r\n	7210141078	2010-04-19 21:44:51
1216	The young fledge at 5055 days of age. In Arizona, Golden Eagle nests averaged 175.7 cm (69.2 in) in length (ranging from 121.9 to 264.2 cm (48.0 to 104.0 in)), 119.8 cm (47.2 in) in width (range of 83.8203.2 cm (33.080.0 in)), and 65.0 cm (25.6 in) in height (range of 12.7200.7 cm (5.079.0 in)). This grebe does not have webbed feet.\r\n	2979958750	2010-07-16 11:34:55
1217	A female may sometimes shade and squat over the eggs but rarely incubate them. The name of the superorder is derived from paleognath, the ancient Greek for  old jaws  in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds. They show light brown parts on the wings in flight..\r\n	4823891882	2010-06-26 13:30:55
1218	Even though the American flamingo resides mainly close to the equator where there is relatively little fluctuations in temperature, seasonal and circadian variations in temperature must be accounted for.. After receiving protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, their range extended northward to re-occupy historical habitat in New England.. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the Scarlet Ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American White Ibis.\r\n	4292031957	2010-06-20 13:51:59
1219	In British Columbia, the primary prey species are sticklebacks, gunnels, sculpins and perch. Specifically regarding birds, it is possible that the mirror neuron system serves as a general mechanism underlying vocal learning, but further research is needed. Six extant and one extinct subspecies of Sharp-tailed Grouse have been described:.\r\n	3612167424	2010-07-27 16:47:37
1220	Together with its sister species, the Common Sandpiper (A. The full scientific name of the sharp-tailed grouse is Tympanuchus phasianellus. They measure 2022 cm (7.98.7 in) in length and 4246 cm (1718 in) across the wings, and weight is from 50105 g (1.83.7 oz)..\r\n	6306585834	2009-08-28 13:31:30

The global population is in the region of 210,000250,000, with the vast majority nesting in Russia and Scandinavia.\r\n	1356658558	2010-03-26 22:29:20
1222	Usage of the term has spread beyond avian behavior;  billing and cooing  in reference to human courtship (particularly kissing) has been in use since Shakespeare s time, and derives from the courtship of doves.. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the Black-footed Albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.. Dry grassland, tidal mudflats and the seashore are less frequently used.\r\n	6254437584	2009-11-27 22:16:17
1223	The eggs are green with brown splotches.. The American White Ibis is found in mixed-species foraging flocks with the Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in flooded fields, and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for crabs and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large carnivores such as bobcats.\r\n	4019297473	2010-11-10 20:33:55
1224	Not all mating takes place at the lek, since only a minority of the males attend an active lek. His sources are the Ornithologia of Ulisse Aldrovandi, Giovanni Pietro Olina s Uccelliera, John Ray s Synopsis methodica Avium & Piscium, and A natural history of the birds by Eleazar Albin. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.\r\n	0650724579	2009-02-18 20:41:14
1225	The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. In most countries where Greater Scaup are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal hunting licences that are required to pursue other game. It is equipped with red bony extensions under the wings (spurs), used to intimidate foes and fight birds of prey..\r\n	8454054191	2010-08-23 11:13:40

While the Langholm Project is working on practical solutions, another project is focusing on raising awareness about the plight of hen harriers and inspiring people to care about them. Ardea herodias herodias Linnaeus, 1758.\r\n	8408676120	2010-09-20 11:55:31
1227	It is usually a permanent resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. Among the major types of aridlands, the best. It occurs in the Americas, including the Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical South America..\r\n	8867521781	2009-02-22 19:20:45
1228	The distinctive white throat (or gular region) in the dark morph gives it the species name. This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Anas albeola.. The departure dates from wintering grounds are variable.\r\n	2537065543	2010-12-15 13:40:22
1229	Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a King Vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Of roughly pigeon like proportions (40 cm), the bird was once also numerous on Norfolk Island (to Australia). Unlike many other cranes that make long migrations, the Sarus Crane is largely non-migratory; it may however make short-distance movements in response to rain or dry weather conditions.\r\n	3271260504	2010-07-16 14:26:56

1232	The body feathers are mostly brownish-black, but the flight feathers on the wings appear to be silvery-gray beneath, contrasting with the darker wing linings. The nature reserve WWT Slimbridge, in England, was instrumental in the successful breeding of Hawaiian Geese in captivity. Adult returning with sand eels to feed the chick.\r\n	5740580965	2009-07-12 15:53:26
1233	Brooding adults also tend to be well camouflaged, and may be difficult to flush from the nest. Their breeding habitat is in tundra pools and marshes, but also along sea coasts and in large mountain lakes in the North Atlantic region, Alaska, northern Canada, northern Europe and Russia. Lesser Scaup females show the characteristic darker iris (bright yellow in Greater Scaup males and females) at closer distances.\r\n	1485271166	2010-06-22 13:13:55

1234	Amongst the day herons there is little sexual dimorphism in plumage (except in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. The Tufted Duck breeds widely throughout temperate and northern Eurasia. The population structure is not well understood.\r\n	3289079417	2010-10-18 19:11:10
1235	It feeds in a distinctive and very active way, chasing insects and other mobile prey, and sometimes then running to the water s edge to wash its catch. In urban areas they are found on the edge of towns on wasteland or irregularly mown areas. At sea, it mainly occurs along the outer edge of the pack ice in summer with water temperatures of -1.5 to 0.5C.\r\n	2993501776	2010-08-10 17:40:47
1236	There are isolated records of Short-tails predating Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus) and American Kestrel (Falco sparverius). They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks.\r\n	9451261030	2010-10-18 22:44:12

1238	Some species also have dual fovea. Nests with eggs were reported as early as April 15 in New Mexico.. The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), and in some areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most widespread of the New World vultures.\r\n	4565805411	2010-07-15 13:19:11
1239	Green Pheasant males on average have a shorter tail than the Common Pheasant and have darker plumage that is uniformly bottle-green on the breast and belly; they always lack a neck ring. The urine collected by the kidney is emptied into the cloaca through the ureters and then to the colon by reverse peristalsis.. The bill of flavirostris is orange-yellow with a dark nail, compared with the bright pink bill of albifrons which has only a hint of dark on the nail; in addition the bill of flavirostris is longer and appears slimmer than that of albifrons.\r\n	6970940233	2010-06-19 10:38:51
1240	During 1948, in Carter County, Montana, 286 Golden Eagles were shot and killed in the month of March alone. and then by the maximum parsimony Steiner method (Polzin and Daneschmand,. The Common Sandpiper forages by sight on the ground or in shallow water, picking up small food items such as insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates; it may even catch insects in flight.\r\n	0429157828	2009-11-19 12:16:34
1241	They roost communally, like other Elanus species.. This suggests that the abundant habitat and food available on Midway has stimulated greater reproductive effort in the ducks, which contributes optimism for the success of this re-introduced population.. The Ruff is a migratory species, breeding in wetlands in colder regions of northern Eurasia, and spends the northern winter in the tropics, mainly in Africa.\r\n	2475601983	2009-06-19 14:36:39
1242	The ratio of the two food types varies by species, with fruit predominating in some species, and arthropods dominating the diet in others. They will readily exploit easy food sources, including chum lines made by boats at sea. A mean of 48 clutches from Algeria and Tunisia showed an average of 1.89 eggs per nests, with a range of 1 to 3.\r\n	5206797026	2009-02-27 16:51:14

On the open ocean, they are found in areas where converging ocean currents produce upwellings and are often found near groups of whales. Adults are mainly slate-grey, with a paler head and underparts.\r\n	8192537886	2010-03-11 11:56:29
1245	In the book, The Long Winter, Laura Ingalls Wilder writes of her father finding a small bird that looked just like a Great Auk hidden in a haystack after an early October blizzard when the family lived near De Smet, South Dakota around 1880. Verbal evidence suggests the Horned Guan is present in the areas known as Cordn El Retn y Sierra Tres Picos (Gonzlez-Garca 2006). It is considered to be an endangered species by the IUCN, due to dramatic declines in the last seventy years, caused by interactions with longline fisheries and the outbreak of introduced diseases, such as Avian Cholera and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\r\n	4130405535	2010-03-20 11:22:24
1246	Many farmers in India believe that these cranes damage standing crops, particularly rice, although studies show that direct feeding on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to less than one percent and trampling could account for grain loss of about 0.415 kilograms (0.8833.07 lb). Anderson commented  We ve definitely seen one chick stretching a wing just before the adult arrived and also after it left and we continue to monitor for more. Its specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek leuko-  white , and opsis  faced ..\r\n	0016448486	2009-10-14 17:21:39
1247	In the southern United States, it commences in March, peaks in April to May, and continues into June. The Pearl Kite feeds mainly on lizards, especially Anolis, but also takes small birds and insects; it usually sits on a high open perch from which it swoops on its prey. Beetles (Coleoptera) account for the highest proportion of the birds  diet, followed by spiders (Araneae) and snails (Gastropods), whereas plant matter is dominated by sedges (Cyperaceae) and rushes (Juncaceae)..\r\n	7232679495	2009-06-27 14:25:37
1248	It will also take crabs, isopods and barnacles. Large numbers of Blue-winged Teal appear on wintering grounds in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas in September. The male weighs approximately 5 kg (11 lb) and the female 38 kg (6.617.6 lb).\r\n	6180380607	2009-04-19 19:35:42
1249	Around three-quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce. The clutch consists of three to four dull white eggs of a tapered oval shape measuring 42 x 31 mm and with red-brown blotches that are often heavier around the larger end of the egg. It primarily feeds on insects, especially in the breeding season, but it will consume plant material, including rice and maize, on migration and in winter.\r\n	8031155735	2009-02-20 16:41:23
1250	Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. It is a typical black and white mollymawk with a grey head and large eye patch, and its nape and hindneck are white. A completely isolated population of Golden Eagles is found in Ethiopias Bale Mountains, at the southern limit of this species range worldwide. Overall ground cover is between 10 and 50%.\r\n	4666618027	2010-03-22 12:47:17

1252	Albatrosses are highly philopatric, meaning they will usually return to their natal colony to breed. According to Mayan mythology, this god often carried messages between humans and the other gods. The Golden Eagle is considered an occasional predator of California Condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be little in the way of eye-witness accounts to confirm this. Sexes are similar, but immature birds have white-streaked grey upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts.\r\n	6373717035	2009-04-18 22:14:46
1253	The birds are found in woodland, farmland, scrub, and wetlands. On Isabela Island, introduced cats, dogs, and rats attack penguins and destroy their nests. Two bony projectionsthe upper and lower mandiblesare covered with a thin keratinized layer of epidermis known as the rhamphotheca. Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather.\r\n	6349550166	2009-08-26 18:20:50
1254	It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Ruffs were formerly trapped for food in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at Archbishop Neville s enthronement banquet in 1465. This suggests that species do not have any clear boundaries but are rather momentary statistical effects of constantly changing gene-frequencies.\r\n	9530751564	2009-04-21 21:54:28
1255	It is sometimes argued that the Mtraszls fossil is too old to represent any of the modern seaduck genera, but apparently these were all well-distinct even back then.. During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called  sub-song , which is akin to babbling in human infants. When approached from below their level, they attempt to climb up the slopes on foot and when approached from above the dive down the valleys on open wings. Terre Adlie has shown a drastic reduction as the count fell to 1015 pairs from 80 pairs in the 1980s.\r\n	4819708356	2010-07-12 20:28:12

Its weight ranges from 2.74.5 kilograms (610 lb). There are unconfirmed reports from Cerro Volcn Pacayita, Honduras. It lays three to eight eggs at a time in a ground nest..\r\n	6834095641	2010-11-19 21:35:46
1257	The female, less colourful, has a white eye-ring and a whitish throat. The Laysan Albatross s plumage has been compared to that of a gull, two-toned with a dark grey mantle and wings and a white underside and head.. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. The only other group, however, which shows the same behavior, the Pteroclidae, is placed near the doves just by this doubtlessly very old characteristic. .\r\n	8688838482	2010-01-20 20:38:31
1258	When hunting mammalian carnivores, the eagle may hover for some time over the potential prey and not press the attack unless the mammal looks down. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Golden Eagles are very hardy species, being well adapted to cold climates, however they cannot abide declining available food sources in the northern stretches of their range. Dancing is an integral part of courtship, but also may be done at any time of the year..\r\n	1281915727	2010-11-23 19:48:52
1259	Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. A common technique is to fly up to a gannet in mid-air and grab it by the wing, so that it stalls and falls into the sea, where the Great Skua then physically attacks it until it surrenders its catch. It will often make its presence known, however, with its distinctive ki-ki-krr call or an aggressive, presumably territorial, growl. It is closer in size to the Eurasian Great Crested Grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye..\r\n	5932833637	2010-08-22 13:46:18
1260	Identifying and naming species is the providence of alpha taxonomy.. The call is a very loud and harsh keek-keek-keek.. It may be related to an Old High German masculine proper name Madelhart, clues lying in the alternate English forms  maudelard  or  mawdelard .. It is a mid-sized short-legged and -necked heron, generally medium brown with a tight darker barring in adult birds[verification needed].\r\n	8506359804	2010-02-25 19:26:48
1261	Adults have short yellowish legs and an orange bill with a dark tip. In 2011 breeding success fell to 61% (Bell, unpublished data) for unknown reasons. This adaptation, more specialized in shovelers, gives them an advantage over other puddle ducks, with which they do not have to compete for food resources during most of the year. These key aspects can now be assessed using the Robel pole, Nudds cover board, and Limb et al.\r\n	7234492304	2010-03-22 19:17:28

1263	Anterior forebrain pathway (vocal learning): composed of Area X, which is a homologue to mammalian basal ganglia; the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of anterior neostriatum (LMAN), also considered a part of the avian basal ganglia; and the dorso-lateral division of the medial thalamus (DLM).. The male has a high pitched whistling call, and the female cackles like the related Egyptian Goose.. The practice of surface coal mining threatens the limited nesting sites in Wyoming. When threatened, the young may cling to their parent s body to be flown away to safety..\r\n	6164464954	2009-03-24 19:45:18
1264	This highly gregarious sandpiper is migratory and sometimes forms huge flocks in its winter grounds, which include southern and western Europe, Africa, southern Asia and Australia. It is carrying a twig in its beak for its nest. Egg laying occurs from March to June in Texas and Mexico, and from April to September in New Mexico. The clutch comprises about 11 eggs (ranging from 6 to 12), which are  whitish  or  chalk-white .\r\n	5891838314	2010-03-17 21:11:46
1265	The eggs hatch in 24 to 28 days. Although it sometimes occurs with the African Crake, that species normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the Corn Crake. conditions in the small swath of the Andes in which it. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel.\r\n	5887223898	2009-06-11 15:43:13
1266	Laughing Gulls breed in coastal marshes and ponds in large colonies. The Western Marsh-harrier is often divided into two subspecies, the widely migratory C. Similar fossil geese found on O?ahu and Kaua?i may be of the same species. The avian visual system is usually highly developed.\r\n	5415320281	2009-09-25 19:46:22
1282	In other regions, populations are stable or fluctuating.. The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.. It lacks a syrinx, so therefore its vocalizations are limited to grunts or low hisses.. When they hunt ground squirrels, Golden Eagles seem to choose their victim in the last few seconds before they strike.\r\n	6649071614	2009-07-19 13:13:22
1267	It is therefore now classed as Least Concern, since the major populations in Russia and Kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term. In many other areas, ground squirrels are secondary prey, usually ranking after lagomorphs in dietary significance. Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to help to keep pollen from clogging their nasal passages, while the opercula of the two species of Attagis seedsnipe help to keep dust out. However histological and Evo-Devo work in this area revealed that these structures lack beta-keratin (a hallmark of reptilian scales) and are entirely composed of alpha-keratin .\r\n	5023462671	2009-03-15 22:59:42
1268	DNA analysis of this species has revealed it is very close genetically to the Cinnamon Teal, another American teal with blue wings.. When alerted they will climb on the back of a parent grebe and eventually mature to dive under the water like their parents. By the early 20th century, over-hunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform.\r\n	6662791361	2009-02-13 16:25:45
1269	Darters are mostly tropical in distribution, ranging into subtropical and barely into warm temperate regions. Albatrosses live much longer than other birds, they delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. Common Cranes may loosely associate with any other crane in the Grus genus in migration or winter as well as greater white-fronted geese and bean geese.. Birds were later used in religious or symbolic art and design, such as the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors.\r\n	7175319689	2010-10-18 20:14:58
1270	sagebrush, and wet meadows as food resources. swallowed (but not crushed), and the seeds are subsequently regurgitated (Schfer 1953).. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. Even though it has been deemed Of Least Concern by IUCN, in the United States this bird is a protected species according to many northern states  hunting rules..\r\n	1332766960	2010-08-18 16:33:25
1271	Carotenoids act as antioxidants and stimulants for the Blue-footed Booby s immune function, suggesting that carotenoid-pigmentation is an indicator of an individual s immunological state Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a booby. In some cases, the color of a bird s tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The flocks move slowly along the quieter suburban roads, looking for food on the grassy  pavements  and in gardens where the fence is low enough for some to enter without feeling separated from the flock. The male is all black with a bulbous bill which shows some yellow coloration around the nostrils.\r\n	5689210619	2010-08-21 18:21:57
1272	It is restricted in range to southwestern Colorado and extreme southeastern Utah, with the largest population residing in the Gunnison Basin region in Colorado. The precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching. The Whooper Swan is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.. Compared to other shearwaters, the species is unusually easy to identify at sea by its combination of considerable size and the distinctive M-shaped banding pattern on its upperside while flying, uniquely among its genus and more akin to some gadfly petrels (Pterodroma), the prions (Pachyptila) and their relative, the Blue Petrel (Halobaena caerulea).\r\n	7785038632	2009-08-24 18:16:45
1273	Their breeding habitat is coastal mountainsides, where they have large colonies. Dusting sites are visible as areas of disturbed soils with some signs of feathers. Waterfowl are typically hunted using the contour flight with short glide attack technique, in order to surprise the prey before it can take flight or dive. It attends these colonies nocturnally, although non-breeding Wedge-tails are often seen at the surface throughout the day and breeding birds will rest outside their burrows before laying..\r\n	7748744448	2010-02-10 21:15:56
1274	Both birds incubate the egg; the male does so first. It is located adjacent to the renamed Trumpeter subdivision of Edmonton, Alberta within Big Lake.. The Tiny Hawk, another neotropical species, attains a slightly higher weight than the Pearl Kite. Cliff nests are preferred as nesting sites in most of North America.\r\n	4989472799	2009-09-14 17:24:44
1275	When Lowness is unsafe as Hight,. A captive pair displayed by raising their plumes.. Its global population is estimated to be 4,500,000 individuals. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years.\r\n	6385131811	2010-04-12 12:33:47
1276	This approach also suggested a type of idealism: the notion that each species existed as an  ideal form . This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Anas acuta. It has a white face and crown, and black rear head. The young birds are fed insects at first; adults also eat some molluscs and insects during the nesting season.\r\n	3727294704	2009-07-19 11:15:24
1277	In Europe the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe; southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981 and Italy in 1985. It has a clutch size of approximately 511 egg, which are greenish drab. Meadow Pipits (Anthus pratensis) are the most represented species and are taken mainly in Scotland, making up to 3.5% of prey in the Inner Hebrides. Research has demonstrated  that water-level control in the Everglades is depleting the population of apple snails.\r\n	2399312073	2009-12-23 12:56:40
1278	Apparently, the Bonelli s Eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. These marks were registered with the Crown and a Royal Swanherd was appointed. At Minto Lakes, Alaska, Green-winged Teal initiate nesting as early as June 1 and as late as July 20.. Initially, it was placed in the dabbling duck subfamily Anatinae.\r\n	6151326098	2009-05-26 15:17:12
1279	Despite this, males typically tend to develop sooner and fledge more quickly than the females. This method is not comprehensive for prey analysis, as particularly small prey may leave no trace and it cannot take into account the prey selected by wintering adults and highly nomadic juvenile eagles (both of which are believed to include a higher level of carrion and large prey items). When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. Once the adults are mated they seek out their own territories and often live close to ducks and gulls, which may take advantage of the swan s ability to reach deep water weeds, which tend to spread out on the water surface..\r\n	4825903340	2009-05-16 11:38:56
1280	It occurs further north in the cool waters of the Humboldt Current, reaching Peru. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. A large clutch could indicates brood parasitism by other Greater Scaups or even ducks of other species. Incubation is done by both sexes and lasts 68 to 71 days.\r\n	2177205301	2010-09-22 18:45:26
1281	Females have a suggestion of the male s face pattern. They leave the breeding grounds from August to October. It breeds in colonies in trees close to large lakes with reed beds or other extensive wetlands. By the early 20th century, over-hunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range.\r\n	8146235649	2009-06-13 10:12:57
1283	The long coiled trachea that produces the trumpeting calls. meserythrus occurs in southern Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and northern and eastern Nicaragua.. The Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea) is a small heron. Its diet consists almost exclusively of apple snails..\r\n	3072632468	2010-11-21 23:48:33
1284	During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff plumes on the back, breast and crown, and the bill, legs and irises become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. Just as it is going to hit the water a bird will fold its wings against its body. It has a chicken-like appearance due to its long tail and legs. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis also states that song characteristics may take advantage of beneficial acoustic properties of the environment.\r\n	1310974142	2009-06-20 21:22:32
1285	The adult female has a reddish crest, with much of the rest of the head and body a greyish-brown. Such examples help make the case that food supplies, not weather per se, drive migration patterns.. Medium-distance migrants: Some species may cover distances that span from one to several states. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm.\r\n	7597394317	2009-04-11 17:12:55
1286	Only some Old World vultures and the California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) (among the other raptorial birds this eagle co-exists with) are distinctly larger than the Golden Eagle, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight and often have dramatically different color patterns. It is incubated for about 45 days with both parents taking turns in stints of 39 days. However, one study of Short-tailed Shearwaters observed the divorce rate in a colony to be as high as 16% annually.. The nest is a deep cup of sticks built high in a tree.\r\n	9873052330	2009-03-25 20:17:10
1287	Studies showed pigs (most certainly taken as carrion) made up to 13.3% of the diet in Corsica and 43.1% on Santa Cruz Island, California. Their primary call is a clear whistle, uttered in flight and while hovering.. The feathers of the nape and top-neck are rich brown-red. Several males may congregate at a lek site and these males are often closely related.\r\n	9418260687	2009-10-24 19:17:48
1288	Occasionally recorded as a vagrant in various parts of the Indian Subcontinent.. The common English name dates from the 17th century and comes from dialect Italian gargenei, a variant of garganello, which ultimately comes from the Late Latin gargala  tracheal artery . Buffleheads are hunted and are considered a gamebird. The Australian Black-shouldered Kite was formerly called E.\r\n	6107418316	2010-01-16 16:42:50
1289	They feed predominantly on squid, taking also some fish, crustacea, carrion, cephalopods, and lampreys. It spends days and nights on the wing, with an average ground speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph), covering up to 223 km (139 mi) before landing. Across the range, pheasants make up 5.7% of the diet of this species. Lesser White-fronted Goose is considered an endangered species, but there are programmes to reintroduce animals into the wild to strengthen the population.\r\n	5751532339	2010-04-19 11:20:20
1290	However, they are readily told apart, by means of osteology. Studies at South Georgia s Bird Island have shown that the growing chick is fed 616 g (21.7 oz) of food every 1.2 days, with the chick increasing in weight to around 4,900 g (170 oz). They are omnivorous, eating insects (especially grasshoppers), aquatic plants, fish (perhaps only in captivity), frogs, crustaceans and seeds. Its numbers are rising again in many places, most notably perhaps in Great Britain, where a single breeding female was left in 1971, whereas today over 200 pairs are present..\r\n	9820103904	2009-04-26 16:22:47
1291	The optimal molting lake is fairly shallow, has an abundance of food sources, and cover. Groups of females observe these displays and select the most attractive males to mate with. It has the California Department of Fish and Game protective status California species of special concern (CSC). Young males look like the females but the wings are chestnut coloured..\r\n	3547805888	2010-08-16 22:20:35
1292	The first record of a Golden Eagle eating eggs was recorded when a Golden Eagle was observed consuming Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) eggs in eastern Idaho. However, in a field study published in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the Scarlet and White Ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. They do not have white under their wings when flying, like other grebes.\r\n	7220723698	2009-04-16 22:25:51
1293	It was for a long time misspelt mutus, in the erroneous belief that the ending of Lagopus denotes masculine gender. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.. The dark phase results from a single dominant gene and the white phase is homozygous recessive. Birds communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals.\r\n	4315471377	2009-12-21 19:28:23
1294	New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. This makes sense for foragers because the food source is one that can be locally abundant. First, it suggests that species are not just similar, they may actually be related. Little Egret flying with neck retracted, India.\r\n	4486421676	2010-08-17 12:58:23
1295	Only a few other gulls, including Pallas s Gull (Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus) and Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus), come close to matching this species  size. The age of sexual maturity in wild birds has been estimated at variously from 3 to 6 years of age. Formerly called Tubinares and still called tubenoses in English, they are often referred to collectively as the petrels, a term that has been applied to all Procellariiformes, or more commonly all the families except the albatrosses. If discovered while perched, they are relatively easy to shoot, since they usually perch for extended periods of time..\r\n	4280242617	2009-03-15 17:47:15
1296	They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2 weeks, fledge at 30 days and become independent at around the 45th day.. However, high densities have been reported in areas where nearly 80% of the grassland was under cultivation.. Early experiments by Thorpe in 1954 showed the importance of a bird being able to hear a tutor s song. The King Vulture soars for hours effortlessly, only flapping its wings infrequently.\r\n	4132985826	2010-03-17 22:29:33
1297	One requisite of the habitat is perches such as poles, lone trees, knolls, rocky outcrops or large boulders. The Canvasback feeds mainly by diving, sometimes dabbling, mostly eating seeds, buds, leaves, tubers, roots, snails, and insect larvae. There have also been sightings of Falcated teals in America, Poland and Thailand. Most commonly, the harriers are the aggressors pirating prey from owls..\r\n	0219394183	2010-07-14 17:51:53
1313	Aristotle and other pre-Darwinian scientists took the species to be distinct and unchanging, with an  essence , like the chemical elements. Thus, the identical specific epithets never came into direct conflict until recently. The Rufous-vented Chachalaca (Ortalis ruficauda) is a member of an ancient group of birds of the Cracidae family, which are related to the Australasian mound builders. The lower breast plumage is dark grey, and the sides of the body are streaked with black, chestnut and white.\r\n	4139725517	2010-04-21 16:57:25
1298	Although it sometimes occurs with the African Crake, that species normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the Corn Crake. Wherever they are hunted they are always timid once they associate humans with danger, and will quickly retreat for safety after hearing the arrival of hunting parties in the area.. Males will return to the same burrow every year and try to attract another female if their mate does not return or if there is a divorce (about 12% annually) (Bell et al. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical swamps..\r\n	5911451459	2010-10-12 13:27:10
1299	The species can weigh 4541,089 g (1.0012.401 lb); males weigh 820 g (1.81 lb) on average and weigh noticeably less, at 730 g (1.61 lb) on average. The legend was widely repeated in, for example, Vincent of Beauvais s great encyclopedia. The smallest 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) Cackling Geese (B. Subspecies schistacea is found from the Red Sea coast east round the Indian coast.\r\n	8136136850	2010-06-12 10:50:59
1300	Length is 1825 cm (7.19.8 in), wingspan is 3041 cm (1216 in) and weight is 3373 g (1.22.6 oz). In summer the birds can also forage on the ground, eating berries, green plants, fungi, and some insects. The female builds the nest out of grass, locating it in tall vegetation to hide it from predators. This Andean Flamingo is native to the wetlands of the high Andes mountain range from southern Per to northwestern Argentina and northern Chile.\r\n	9483623962	2009-08-24 21:17:27
1301	They build large nests, platforms made of reeds and vegetation in wet marshes or paddy fields. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first citation for the  Canada Goose  dates back to 1772. This sound is unique to the species, and can be heard from a range of 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1 mi), indicating its value as a contact sound between birds in flight. The Black Oystercatcher is a large entirely black shorebird, with a long (9 cm) bright red bill and pink legs.\r\n	0910778230	2009-04-22 10:36:27
1302	It often breeds further within reed beds than other grebes. It is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds, though it is possibly closely related to the real ancestor.. The Grey-tailed Tattler is closely related to its North American counterpart, the Wandering Tattler (T. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but will also take an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest.\r\n	7020465638	2009-11-15 22:13:44
1303	It was known as Mardungurra among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara.. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and heavily degraded former forest.. The Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), also known as Baird s Cormorant, is a small member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae.

The Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) is a large (5071 cm body length) sea-duck that is distributed over the northern coasts of Europe, North America and eastern Siberia. The Grey-headed Chachalaca is less noisy than Plain or Rufous-vented Chachalacas.\r\n	8460966692	2009-10-13 13:16:53
1305	Birds were later used in religious or symbolic art and design, such as the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. Only in severe storms might this species be pushed into headlands. The nests are piles of sticks around 69 cm (27 in) in diameter and 15.243 cm (6.016.9 in) high with a cup-shaped depression in the middle that is 20.2 cm (8.0 in) across and 10.1 cm (4.0 in). When the penguins are breeding, incubation takes 3840 days with both parents helping out.\r\n	4278469207	2009-06-27 19:33:49
1306	Breeding success is low and chick mortality high.. The nests of herons are usually found near or above water. There are colonies on a number of the islands around Antarctica such as the South Sandwich Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island and Peter I Island. Wild adults weigh between 90 and 100 grams while their domesticated counterparts typically weigh between 100 and 120 grams.\r\n	8427855631	2009-10-15 10:43:23
1307	The Northern Lapwing is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.. The northern regions experience a steady decline in Blue-winged Teal populations from early September until early November. The 3 or 4 greenish eggs are incubated for about three weeks. Many birds can be washed up on beaches after storms.\r\n	1575703083	2010-02-13 11:31:53
1308	They are produced from fir timber tossed along the sea, and are at first like gum. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Black Francolin female: The female is mainly brown, but has a chestnut hind neck. Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons, skunks, badgers, foxes, crows and ravens, dogs and owls.\r\n	6521035078	2010-11-24 23:11:34
1309	Since the environment effectively selects which organisms live to reproduce, it is the environment (the  fight for existence ) that selects the traits to be passed on. Poisoning, both intentional and unintentional, is perhaps the most insidious man-made threat to Golden Eagles. Each pair builds a compact floating nest of vegetationtypically a variety of aquatic weedswhich is anchored to rooted plants in still open water as deep as 1.5 m (5 ft). Additionally affecting the Red-shouldered Hawk was the greater availability of firearms in the early 1900s, leading to unchecked hunting of this and all other raptor species until conservation laws took effect in the latter half of the 20th century.\r\n	8870478103	2009-02-15 11:50:24
1310	On the breeding grounds, the Red-necked Grebe feeds mainly on invertebrates including adult and larval aquatic insects, such as water beetles and dragonfly larvae, crayfish and molluscs. Booted eagles have legs and feet feathered to the toes and build very large stick nests.. The Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja) of the neotropical forests is often cited as the largest eagle, as well, and captive females have weighed up to 12.3 kg (27 lb). Females are somewhat smaller than males.\r\n	8431445755	2009-04-21 13:41:33

The numbers of this species have been adversely affected by intensive agricultural techniques. The two largest known reports are from coastal California and along the Porcupine River in Alaska, with fish making up 3.6% and 3.5% of the diets, respectively.\r\n	1287111170	2009-06-16 19:15:37
1312	arquata) can weigh up to 1.36 kg (3.0 lb).. It is noted that swimming birds have a wide sternum, while walking birds had a long or high sternum while flying birds have the width and height nearly equal.. Together with the equally light-billed Pink-footed Shearwater, it forms the Hemipuffinus group, a superspecies which may or may not have an Atlantic relative in the Great Shearwater. The nest is a small flattish stick platform in a tree into which 23 green-tinged white eggs are laid..\r\n	6914613955	2009-01-23 12:14:51

1314	The present species is known to produce fertile hybrids with the Pacific Black Duck and the Philippine Duck in captivity, and naturally hybridizes with the Mallard as their ranges now overlap in the Primorsky Krai due to the Spotbill s northward expansion.. Main article: Animal navigation. Devastation to vegetation could increase sedimentation of the lakes and seeps that serve as important foraging habitat. In 2003, there were about 153 pairs of whooping cranes.\r\n	0193709918	2009-07-28 23:30:38
1315	Species which use natural cavities or old woodpecker nests sometimes line the cavity with soft material such as grass, moss, lichen, feathers or fur. Individual recognition, territorial and partnership fidelity. The dark phase results from a single dominant gene and the white phase is homozygous recessive. The beak was also particularly soft, and may have been used to probe through sediment for food..\r\n	1333088693	2010-02-17 22:27:19
1316	Incubation begins when the first egg is laid resulting in chicks with size disparities. Among the redbreasted Charadrius plovers, this bird is relatively large, longlegged and long-winged.. To curb the destructive practice of afforestation, some locals have switched to planting native Caledonian pine forests instead, likely resulting in much less harm to the native fauna possibly including Golden Eagles. In Ecuador this species is probably extinct.\r\n	6384433666	2009-10-17 12:13:12
1317	The habitat of sharp-tailed grouse was severely affected by early settlers before cattle grazers understood the impact to the environment from overgrazing.. Russian Tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) made up 31.9% of the prey in 5 nests in Turkmenistan and 25.4% of the prey in 36 nests in Kazakhstan. These birds feed by swimming under water or diving. If it is able to surprise the grouse, the eagle has a split second to grab the prey before it flies off.\r\n	1461853933	2009-03-22 19:55:18
1318	Their nests are built in pines, oaks, Douglas firs, beeches, spruces, and other tree species usually on flat ground rather than on a hillside. Because it roosts in trees, it particularly likes regions where open areas are mixed with woodlots. The species name valisineria comes from the plant Vallisneria americana, whose winter buds and rhizomes are the Canvasback s preferred food during the nonbreeding period. Today, it is believed that three major groups can be distinguished, which are (from the most primitive to the most advanced):.\r\n	4983110542	2010-08-13 23:10:58
1319	Pairs shows high fidelity to the nest site, often refurbishing and reusing nests for as many as five breeding seasons. In a long-lived bird with a small clutch size such as the Atlantic Puffin, the survival rate of adults is an important factor influencing the success of the species. In the past it also bred in some numbers on the main islands, however this is seen as unlikely today. The hummingbirds are also traditionally included in this order, the largest species of which is easily the Giant Hummingbird(Patagona gigas) of the Andes Mountains.\r\n	4054048244	2010-03-20 13:22:39
1320	The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral King Vultures and South American Condors separated at least some 5 mya.. Adults usually measure 138165 cm (5465 in) long, though large males can range up to 180 cm (71 in) or more. Mowbray was the first to successfully breed the Galapagos Penguins in captivity.. They nest in colonies on platforms of sticks in trees over water, which may gather more than 100 nests (Fleck 2003).\r\n	2412306443	2010-12-27 17:33:35
1321	Thus the heaviest single waterfowl ever recorded was a cob Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) from Poland, which weighed 23 kg (50 lb) and was allegedly too heavy to take flight.. Lower Colorado River Authority to withhold water. The Wandering Albatross has the largest wingspan of any living bird, typically ranging from 2.51 to 3.5 m (8 ft 3 in to 11 ft 6 in), with a mean span of 3.1 m (10 ft 2 in) in the Bird Island, South Georgia colony and an average of exactly 3 m (9 ft 10 in) in 123 birds measured off the coast of Malabar, New South Wales. Black francolins appear to be found in scrubby habitats with plenty of cultivated crops tall enough to offer shelter and open beneath to provide escape routes and easy travel.\r\n	5538904676	2010-08-24 11:36:11
1322	This number is dwarfed by the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the Atlantic Puffin being the most populous bird on the island. This of course is not true; there is no real difference in the efficiency of the blood, and both mammals and birds use a hemoglobin molecule as the primary oxygen carrier with little to no difference in oxygen carrying capacity. No charges were brought as police were unable to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute.. histrionicus histrionicus, and the Western race as H.\r\n	1043868538	2009-04-17 13:51:48
1323	The term migration is used to describe movements of populations of birds (or other animals). Like other cranes, they form long-lasting pair-bonds and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship displays that include loud trumpeting, leaps and dance-like movements. They have also been recorded from Ireland east to Portugal and Italy, and from France, 13,000 BP (Desbrosse and Mourer-Chauvire 19721973).[full citation needed] The paleosubspecies Cygnus olor bergmanni, which differed only in size from the living bird, is known from fossils found in Azerbaijan.. The American White Ibis is found in a variety of habitats, although shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred.\r\n	7867086875	2010-03-27 13:27:54
1324	It is a migrant, wintering at sea in the Atlantic Ocean and regularly reaching North American waters. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.. Both will use nests built by the other species, more so the Golden using Bonelli s nests than vica versa. The Wood Stork is the only stork that presently breeds in North America.\r\n	8438168195	2009-04-27 20:59:30
1325	They will feed on insects on the surface of vegetation and ovules of water lilies. The short tail of the Christmas Shearwater does not appear blunt except when spread, but in flight usually tapers to a point, enhanced by the feet which protrude beyond the tail-tip. As a consequence, farmers  problems caused by goose grazing on farmland has increased considerably. It returns to the colony only at night, laying two eggs which are incubated for about a month.\r\n	3715413364	2010-01-27 17:21:35
1326	Zone-tailed Hawks are very active foragers, hunting almost exclusively by transects and random quartering in low flight at around 1030 m (3398 ft) over the ground. Nests in Kazakhstan averaged 148.3 cm (58.4 in) in length, 115.7 cm (45.6 in) in diameter and 48 cm (19 in) in depth. Many passerines and a few non-passerines, including some hummingbirds and some swifts, build this type of nest.. Wolverines were observed to prey on nestling Golden Eagles in Denali National Park.\r\n	7533307388	2010-10-18 22:46:13

1366	Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut.\r\n	2443862786	2009-05-15 13:40:28
1327	Until recently it was thought that albatross were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, predators, or death. The American Flamingo breeds in the Galpagos, coastal Colombia, Venezuela and nearby islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Hispaniola, Cuba, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and along the northern coast of the Yucatn Peninsula. The front part of its body shows adult plumage.. This species is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern, and even though it is hunted for food, its population seems to be stable.\r\n	9042791332	2010-05-13 16:57:32
1328	Alongside the Great Bustard, the Kori Bustard is the heaviest extant flying bird.. The nestling period lasts around 36 days, and the post-fledging period at least 36 days with parental feeding for at least 22 days. The distinctive black and white pattern of the wings is a common sight along many North American coastal beaches.. Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.\r\n	1823009999	2009-06-26 18:33:45
1329	The Mississippi Kite (Ictinia mississippiensis) is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. The opening of their auditory canal is very small and is covered with feathers, they can also be closed in water using a system that is similar to that used for the nostrils. A variation of the high soar where a lofty perch is used instead of soaring flight has been observed. 2008, Tanimoto 2008, Eisermann & Avendao 2011, Gonzlez Madrid 2011, Eisermann in litt.\r\n	8322039646	2010-08-20 17:24:13
1330	The adult s upper parts are mainly dark grey, with a short white wing bar and white tail sides. This species is generally found below 4,500 ft (c. The distances involved in bird migration mean that they often cross political boundaries of countries and conservation measures require international cooperation. Californian herons were found to live mostly off of sculpin, bass, perch, flounder and top smelt .\r\n	1513140045	2010-07-24 12:21:51
1331	The American Wigeon is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some taller vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which it does very readily. 75% of the Wood Ducks in the Pacific Flyway are non-migratory. The lower neck is metallic green and the breast feathers are dark brown glossed with green. The bill measures 10.512 cm (4.14.7 in) and is up to twice the length of a Canada Goose s (Branta canadensis) bill.\r\n	1264562184	2010-05-20 12:13:14
1332	Sibley and Ahlquist s molecular study of the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (3530 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The American White Ibis is a tactile, nonvisual forager, which limits its ability to choose from a wide variety of prey. Raccoons are the leading predator of nests, and can cause almost complete colony nesting failure when water dries under nests in drought years since they can easily access the nest using dry ground under the tree. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments.\r\n	1333802369	2010-02-19 16:26:27
1333	The songs of different species of birds vary and are generally typical of the species. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The maximum recorded age for a wild Great Black-backed Gull is 27.1 years. They usually just cruise at about 20 to 30 miles per hour.\r\n	4579215018	2009-03-25 21:36:53
1334	After the egg is laid by the female, the embryo continues to develop in the egg outside the female body.. In a larger colony, increased competition for food can make it harder for parents to feed their chicks.. They may pursue prey on the ground by half running and half flying.. The Booted is a small eagle, comparable to the Common Buzzard in size though more eagle-like in shape.\r\n	2494335106	2009-03-18 18:28:28
1335	Following the elimination of the rats, it is hoped that populations will recover, and in 2005, a juvenile was seen, believed to be the first chick raised on the island for thirty years. The bill is short and straight at birth and has an egg tooth which falls off between days five and nine, and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. Those returning geese are in much better physical condition than was the case when geese did not use agricultural grain but foraged in marshland.. Immature birds have dull grey-brown plumage on their heads, wings, and backs, with numerous pale spots.\r\n	5149791620	2009-04-20 22:43:51
1336	Moreover, the bird had been extensively discussed before Linnaeus established binomial nomenclature. The bill may give a hint; in the Lesser Scaup it has a stronger curve on the upperside than in the Greater, resulting in a distal part that looks somewhat flattened and wide in the Lesser Scaup  hence the vernacular name  broadbill . In comparison with the Turkey Vulture, the Black Vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. Female Chaffinches in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males do..\r\n	8847912068	2009-10-22 21:20:32
1337	A member of the largest Golden Eagle race (A. It is threatened at its nesting sites by predation from introduced species (cats and rats) and, to a lesser extent, from habitat loss caused by introduced herbivores (goats). The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.. poecilorhyncha zonorhyncha), and Burmese Spot-billed Duck (A.\r\n	3367888108	2009-05-14 10:15:36
1338	Gyrfalcons, skuas, and Buteos like Rough-legged Buzzards, which are normally fierce competitors with each other, have worked together to group-mob Golden Eagles that have passed their adjacent nesting areas. It is a common but wary species. The colour of the head, cheeks and side of the neck depends on the season and the individual, during breeding, the head and neck are brushed in a delicate yellow. Giganhinga Rinderknecht & Noriega, 2002 (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene of Uruguay).\r\n	2582710760	2009-11-12 21:11:54
1339	Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits. Nevertheless, the chicks face many dangers which range from attacks by foxes or birds of prey, getting separated from the rest of the brood, bad weather and coccidiosis. Seals have been known to kill Puffins and large fish may also do so. In a study in northern India (Jodhpur), the number of males was 170210 for 100 females but a study involving evening counts at the roost site in southern India (Injar) suggested a ratio of 47 males for 100 females..\r\n	6423070140	2010-11-23 16:52:16
1340	The Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) is a bird in the grouse subfamily Tetraoninae of the pheasant family Phasianidae. The first reference to a coot in the Hawaiian Islands was by Andrew Bloxam, who encountered the Hawaiian Coot but failed to collect a specimen as he mistook it for the Eurasian Coot, Fulica atra, while in the islands in 1825 as the naturalist on board the HMS Blonde. soconuscensis occurs on the Pacific slope of Chiapas and Oaxaca States, Mexico.. Some factors which affect the habitat area that the American flamingos choose are environmental temperatures, water depth, food source, how accessible an area is and vegetative beds that are in the areas that they feed.\r\n	9075898050	2009-06-12 14:48:28
1367	The bill pattern for every individual Bewick s Swan is unique, and scientists often make detailed drawings of each bill and assign names to the swans to assist with studying these birds.\r\n	6615265581	2009-09-27 23:23:40
1341	The Black-browed Albatross was first described as Diomedea melanophris by Coenraad Jacob Temminck, in 1828, based on a specimen from Cape of Good Hope.. American Black Ducks weigh 7201,640 g (1.593.62 lb), measure 4863 cm (1925 in) in length and 8896 cm (3538 in) across the wings. It cannot be confused with any other duck in its range.. Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a model in which LMAN (of the anterior forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production.\r\n	4063381563	2009-02-26 15:54:58
1342	For the first 30 days or so, the nestlings are fully dependent on their parents to feed them but after that period, they start standing around the edge of the nest and practice food tearing. Although less agile and maneuverable, the Golden Eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the Peregrine Falcons stooping and gliding speeds. These birds forage on mudflats and beaches, probing or picking up food by sight. (2001) observed that sites with a VO of less than 5 cm near possible nesting locations indicated a decline in quality nesting habitat as average VO declined.\r\n	5203602608	2010-05-14 19:55:22
1343	Also the Waved Albatross has been observed practicing kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.. At least a few insects have nociceptors, cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain. At 19-22.5 cm length, Spotted Crakes are slightly smaller than Water Rails, from which they are readily distinguished by the short straight bill, yellow with a red base. In the Snake River canyon in Idaho, nests are 5 to 8 km (3.1 to 5.0 mi) apart, while two other nearby studies in Idaho found the average distance were 4.3 km (2.7 mi) and 4.39 km (2.73 mi), respectively.\r\n	6766762252	2009-06-26 18:22:40
1344	Eggs from Golden Eagle nests that were collected after 1946 in North America had shell thicknesses similar to (of less than a 10% difference) those collected in earlier years. Amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) number in the millions. The first transition was to rice fields, where the geese could graze on weeds and eat the grain left behind by the combine. The large head is dark green with a white throat, and a dark green collar and bronzed crown).\r\n	6617021432	2010-05-17 16:49:58
1345	Lesser Snow Goose population indices are the highest they have been since population records have been kept, and evidence suggests that large breeding populations are spreading to previously untouched sections of the Hudson Bay coastline.. Most of the male Anhinga s body is a glossy black green with the wings, base of wings, and tail being a glossy black blue. Greater Scaup begin breeding when they are two years old, although they may start nesting at age one. Greater Scaup often find themselves entangled in fishing nets, thus large numbers of them drown in nets each year.\r\n	2290360548	2009-09-26 22:47:26
1346	As the young gull ages, the gray-brown coloration gradually fades to more contrasting plumage and the bill darkens to black before growing paler. Brooding behaviour of the female seems to be initiated by specific calls from the chicks when they are cold. The Esquimaux [sic] Curlew appears as plate CCCLVII of Audubon s Birds of America.. and 35 million in the United Kingdom..\r\n	3985368705	2009-09-11 13:54:32
1347	This implies a role in intraspecies aggressive competition.. The main call of the American White Ibis is a honking sound, transcribed as urnk, urnk, or hunk, hunk. The Mottled Duck (Anas fulvigula) or Mottled Mallard is a medium-sized dabbling duck. The birds breeding along the Arctic Ocean coast migrate via Canada and the Great Lakes region to winter at the Atlantic coast of the USA, mainly from Maryland to South Carolina, but some move as far south as Florida.\r\n	6099527441	2009-03-23 20:56:12
1348	In the mountains of Japan and Korea, the Golden Eagle occupies deciduous scrub woodland and carpet-like stands of Siberian Dwarf Pine (Pinus pumila) that merge into grasslands and alpine heathland. The biggest threat to the murrelet is the loss of the old growth forest to logging. The Harpy Eagle is considered critically endangered in Mexico and Central America, where it has been extirpated in most of its former range: in Mexico, it used to be found as far North as Veracruz, but today probably occurs only in Chiapas in the Selva Zoque. It is sometimes separated with other  stints  in Erolia, but, although these apparently form a monophyletic group, the present species  old genus Ereunetes had been proposed before Erolia..\r\n	1717019217	2010-02-21 15:41:50

The size and shape of the beak can vary across species as well as between them; in some species, the size and proportions of the beak vary between males and females. Gyrfalcons, skuas, and Buteos like Rough-legged Buzzards, which are normally fierce competitors with each other, have worked together to group-mob Golden Eagles that have passed their adjacent nesting areas.\r\n	8542864394	2009-05-24 15:56:58
1412	This definition captures a number of intuitive species boundaries, but it remains imperfect. Golden Eagles are sometimes considered the most superlative fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds. The young leave the nest 34 weeks after hatching; at this point, usually only one young per nest has survived.\r\n	7419614483	2010-10-25 12:19:24

1418	Storm petrels use a variety of techniques to aid flight. This probably represents less than 20% of all species on Earth, and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most species likely will remain undescribed for many years unless species descriptions increase in rate. Colony-nesting birds often show synchrony in their breeding, meaning that chicks all hatch at once, with the implication that any predator coming along at that time would find more prey items than it could possibly eat..\r\n	0544223512	2010-09-26 16:57:11
1419	This petrel is the largest of the Procellariidae and measures 8699 cm (3439 in) with a wingspan of 185205 cm (7381 in).

1428	It can dive as deep as 100 ft (30 m) to feed on or near the seafloor. Successful releases were also made in the Seychelles and Rodrigues, but attempts to introduce the species to Mauritius failed. The lack of observed hybrids was a large factor in the view that the species were separate..\r\n	4234261986	2009-05-22 15:40:13
1429	It retreats to the nest chamber as the adult bird brings in its load of fish.. Females are somewhat smaller than males. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased..\r\n	7828848682	2010-06-19 21:36:36
1430	The Aleut and Ainu people of the North Pacific traditionally hunted Tufted Puffin for food and feathers. Pairs of birds will sometimes engage in a duet. In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at Embalse Cerrn Grande, Laguna El Jocotal, and especially Lago de Gija.\r\n	4284689045	2009-04-18 21:35:23
1431	The breast feathers are reddish-brown for males, brown for females. Common Pheasants are traditionally a target of small game poachers in the UK, but due to low value of pheasants in the modern day some have resorted to stealing chicks or poults from pens.

The Tule Geese of the American Pacific coast, which in 2010 numbered approximately 650,000 birds, nest in western Alaska.\r\n	5037835048	2009-07-15 19:40:17
1452	The eagle will frequently abandon the hunt after the grouse has flown, since it is unlikely to overtake such prey in the air unless it gains height over its quarry extremely quickly, although it may be able to gain the appropriate height to tail chase a grouse or even catch it while flying high using the high soar with vertical stoop attack. It forages usually where lowering water levels concentrate fish in open wetlands; it also frequents paddy fields. The tail of vulpinus is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American Red-tailed Hawk.\r\n	4285121266	2009-02-14 17:46:45

1461	Trogons excavate their nests by chewing cavities into very soft dead wood; some species make completely enclosed chambers (accessed by upward-slanting entrance tunnels), while otherslike the extravagantly plumed Resplendent Quetzalconstruct more open niches. Outside the breeding season it migrates further north and most commonly occurs in a broad belt of ocean between Peru and Hawaii.. From the southern United States southwards, and on the Pacific coast, they are year-round residents.\r\n	6447889587	2009-09-17 15:20:25
1462	Distances travelled each year are hard to measure, but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days.. The feathers over a ptarmigan s nostrils help to warm the air it inhales, while those over a woodpecker s nares help to keep wood particles from clogging its nasal passages.. The cob will additionally try and chase the predator out of his family territory, and will keep animals such as foxes and raptors at bay.\r\n	8862942039	2010-06-21 19:38:27
1463	In territorial songbirds, birds are more likely to countersing when they have been aroused by simulated intrusion into their territory. It is usually considered to be the only member of its genus, and the Broad-billed and Sharp-tailed Sandpipers are its closest relatives.. The Pacific Reef Egret has two colour morphs, the light and the dark.\r\n	3005789313	2010-07-17 11:30:13

1656	The species may be found in wooded savannah, patchy woodlands near water, cypress swamps, mangrove swamps or high pine-oak woodlands. But while the Muscovite Company initiated vigorous trade with Russia, they hardly, if at all, traded produce from the Americas; thus they are unlikely to have traded C.\r\n	1447633471	2010-05-15 22:48:39
1465	The only member of the genus Nomonyx, it is intermediate between the rather primitive Black-headed Duck (Heteronetta) and the very apomorphic true stifftails. Puffins can store large quantities of small fish in their bills and carry them to their chicks.. As they find it more difficult to take off from these locations they will often cross the area occupied by an adjacent nest causing an aggressive reaction from the pair occupying that nest, this means that the stress levels are higher in this type of colony than in those on more vertical surfaces.\r\n	1326799602	2010-07-16 23:45:30
1466	These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. In the 1970s, the Lesser Scaup population was estimated at 6.9 million birds on average; in the 1990s it had declined to about half that number, and by the late 2000s it is estimated at 3 million individuals or less. If humans approach the nest both parents may engage in a distraction display but known ground predators (including domestic dogs) are physically attacked almost immediately..\r\n	5742853146	2010-10-23 18:39:54
1467	It may nest in mature trees such as araucarias or exotic trees. The Tacarcuna Wood Quail (Odontophorus dialeucos) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. Natural sources of mortality are largely reported in anecdotes.\r\n	7773103119	2009-01-15 15:31:56

1469	Roersma (2001) also found that grouse in southern Alberta selected taller, woody vegetation compared to all other habitats assessed, and grouse used this area in greater proportions to available woody habitat. Thomas Bewick s A History of British Birds (Volume 1, 1797) mentions a report from  a very intelligent master of a vessel  who,  between the islands of Minorca and Majorca, saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward , and states the situation in Britain as follows:. The King Vulture soars for hours effortlessly, only flapping its wings infrequently.\r\n	6169991826	2010-10-13 15:48:23
1470	The heavy toll on breeding birds, together with loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, meant that the species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963. The Eastern Willet breeds in coastal saltmarshes from Nova Scotia to Mexico and the Caribbean. Important prey species include the Mountain Hare (Lepus timidus) (in the Scottish Highlands and the French Alps), the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (in the Scottish Highlands, Sicily, the Apennine Mountains, Switzerland, Spain, the Central Massif of France and the French Alps), the Brown Hare (Lepus europaeus) (in Switzerland, the Apennine Mountains, the French Alps and Armenia), the Japanese Hare (Lepus brachyurus) (in Japan), the Cape Hare (Lepus capensis) (in Mali and Niger) and the Ethiopian Highland Hare (Lepus starcki) (in the Bale Mountains) In some areas leporids are secondary prey, such as Scandinavia, where the Mountain Hare comprised about 20% of prey items, the maximum known being 28.4% in Northern Finland.\r\n	7186046437	2010-08-23 23:20:13
1471	Its population has declined much in recent times: Listed as a species of Least Concern in 1994, it was uplisted to Near Threatened in 2000 and, as it was determined to be less common than previously believed, to Vulnerable in the 2007 IUCN Red List.. A study of the American White Ibis in southern Florida yielded weight ranges of 872.9 to 1,261 g (1.924 to 2.780 lb) for males and 592.7 to 861.3 g (1.307 to 1.899 lb) for females, with average weights of 1,036.4 g (2.285 lb) for males and 764.5 g (1.685 lb) for females.

1472	In these areas, ricelands act as surrogates. After the brooding period is over, the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The call of the Tiny Hawk is a shrill, high-pitched, somewhat quavery series of 2030 notes of uneven pitch.\r\n	8066322240	2009-09-16 15:43:16
1473	In winter the plumage becomes uniformly pale grey above.. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.. When not breeding, it is totally pelagic, flying and hunting over the open oceans, and migrating eastward to the coasts of Ecuador and Peru..\r\n	3512418908	2009-04-22 12:27:26
1474	Little Egrets have yellow-soled feet and black bills. Most accipitrids will supplement their diet with non-putrid carrion but, of course, none specialized with this as well as the vultures.. The song repertoire also appears to indicate fitness in some species.\r\n	0282644648	2010-04-25 12:36:12
1475	Male Mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species, and even each other, in the same way. Due largely to the discovery of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous neognath member of the duck lineage, Neornithes is now known to have split into several modern lineages by the end of the Mesozoic era. It winters further south in temperate zones, on the coasts of the northern United States.\r\n	7809361033	2009-02-15 12:55:13
1476	Some breeding colonies have been recorded as being located in the same place for hundreds of years. The Golden Eagle is part of the facultative cainists group, along with the Wedge-tailed, Eastern Imperial, Steppe and Greater Spotted Eagles. The Black-breasted Wood Quail (Odontophorus leucolaemus) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family.\r\n	7953184164	2009-07-10 14:30:28
1477	Insects that show hemimetabolism, or incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of molts. Collisions with tall buildings, windows, and other structures, being shot or trapped by hunters, and getting struck by automobiles are a few of the numerous human-made dangers. The names of American dowitchers are misleading, as there is much overlap in their bill lengths.\r\n	2009939448	2009-04-15 11:10:37
1478	The cock faces the hen initially and struts and prances around and sometimes turns around to display the tail. The Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) is a medium-sized gamebird in the grouse family. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down.\r\n	2487534877	2009-05-25 16:38:18
1479	Rufous-vented Chachalaca is a largely arboreal species found in forest and woodland, but it is also found in more open dry scrubby areas. The Greater White-fronted Goose is more closely related to the smaller Lesser White-fronted Goose (A. Cultivated fields and modified grasslands are avoided during the breeding period.\r\n	1515767971	2010-01-21 17:37:25
1480	These threats remain, but the Baikal Teal is recovering, with increased numbers of wintering birds and some increase in habitat area. The largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds (Aepyornis) of Madagascar, which were related to the ostrich. During active feeding bouts, it spends an average of 12.5 seconds beneath the surface on each dive, with surface pauses ranging from 224 seconds..\r\n	2372319472	2010-11-22 17:23:29

1481	Like all flamingos, it lays a single chalky white egg on a mud mound, between May and August; incubation until hatching takes from 28 to 32 days; both parents brood the young for a period of up to 6 years when they reach sexual maturity. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius). It has a slow flight, with its long neck retracted (S-shaped).\r\n	7351601996	2009-08-20 10:19:17
1482	This bird is named after the ornithologist Robert Ridgway.. The pair build the large mound-shaped nest from plant material at an elevated site near open water, and defend a large territory around it. It feeds in a similar way, picking insects and other small prey mainly from grassland or arable..\r\n	1676753550	2010-12-22 16:24:39
1483	The Knob-billed Duck is declining in numbers locally, but due to its wide range it is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their bills. Reports of breeding on Mere Lava, Vanuatu, are more likely to be the very similar Vanuatu Petrel, P.\r\n	4035715103	2009-10-15 14:50:54
1484	Swainson s Hawk has suffered population declines since the first half of the twentieth century and was Blue-listed in the United States from 1972 to 1982. Dancing may include bobs, bows, pirouettes, and stops, as in various crane species. There are two different morphs, the dark which resembles the Northern Giant Petrel, and the more distinct light morph.\r\n	1045440525	2009-11-13 15:12:32
1485	The head and neck are featherless and the skin is dark gray and wrinkled. In Anglo-Indian usage of the 1850s, to peacock meant making visits to ladies and gentlemen in the morning. However, hunting and introduced predators, such as Small Asian Mongooses, pigs, and cats, reduced the population to 30 birds by 1952.\r\n	3957932453	2010-04-26 11:15:37
1486	The rectum absorbs 90% of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The females are mostly brown, with white bands located on their wingtips. Their breeding habitat is inland lakes and marsh ponds in tundra from Alaska through western Canada to western Montana; few breed east of James Bay and the Great Lakes.\r\n	1954125859	2009-09-22 10:49:23
1487	Coopers Hawks have been known to live as long as 12 years in the wild. In adult males, this crest has a large white patch, the head is black and the sides of the duck are reddish-brown. These birds feed by dabbling or walking on land.\r\n	8370701970	2009-12-21 21:35:39
1488	Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering Ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. invasive avian species in Hawaiian agriculture.. This species is strongly migratory, wintering on sandy beaches in east Africa, south Asia and Australasia.\r\n	0190973172	2009-07-21 20:16:41
1489	The experience with a site gained through forming a female-female pair may greatly improve the chances of future successful breeding for the non-genetic parent, which explains why it might be worth the short-term cost of raising another birds offspring. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. The two front toes of the foot are long and have small webs at their bases.\r\n	2450710334	2009-01-26 14:36:34
1490	The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. The wings are stiff and cambered, with thickened streamlined leading edges. Eggs are often fathered by paired males, who  cheat  on their spouses..\r\n	5301184166	2009-04-15 10:35:31
1491	There is some speculation that it may feed cooperatively in pairs, as it is almost always observed in pairs, even during the non-breeding season. Formerly, a number of relatives were included in C. Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes.\r\n	2117916384	2009-06-27 20:40:45
1492	The nares of nestling Tawny Frogmouths are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselvesboth critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. The Eastern Spot-billed Duck is darker and browner; its body plumage is more similar to the Pacific Black Duck. This coyote weighed 13.5 kg (30 lb) after the eagle had consumed some of its internal organs.\r\n	6636215556	2010-09-23 14:29:46
1493	In 2012 it was uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered by the IUCN.. Generally, Crested Eagles are silent but do make a call occasionally that consists of a pair of high whistles, with the second whistle being higher pitched than the first.. Tufted Puffins, for example, are pelagic birds that nest on the steep slopes and rocky crevices on coastal cliffs, often on islands.\r\n	6795686119	2010-11-10 20:17:17
1494	The Guanay Cormorant lays two or three eggs of approximately 63x40 mm in size.. It was re-found offshore from Dawlish town centre on 11 November, and attracted large crowds of birdwatchers. The hen s plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks.\r\n	4226849717	2010-02-18 13:47:41
1495	The summer adult s body is white apart from the dark grey back and wings and black head. It is considered a vulnerable species because of its restricted breeding range.. Skydancer is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and United Utilities, and supported by the Forestry Commission..\r\n	6431712261	2010-10-12 12:17:51
1496	In addition, ocean acidification may result in a decline of crustacean prey species due to the effects that excess CO2 will have on the animals shells. They are very scarce in Ireland.. Damaged or broken wings are a frequent cause of death in adults.\r\n	6149550387	2009-04-16 21:21:26
1497	This is evidenced by other names suggesting the species came from lands where it is not actually native, but from where much  outlandish  produce was imported at that time (see below).. It has a loud cackling call, HOOOOOONK!, like the domestic goose.. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.:13.\r\n	9810276556	2010-06-22 11:20:12
1498	Outside the breeding season the Chinese Egret occurs in shallow tidal estuaries, mudflats and bays, occasionally visiting rice-fields and fish ponds. The muskeg of the taiga in Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada, and the surrounding area was the last remnant of the former nesting habitat of the Whooping Crane Summer Range. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette.\r\n	6528917932	2009-05-20 14:42:48
1499	The term migration is used to describe movements of populations of birds (or other animals). In Oklahoma, egg laying usually starts in late April. The Slaty-breasted Tinamou averages 27 cm (11 in) in length, and weighs about 470 g (1.04 lb).\r\n	5972103994	2010-10-12 23:51:39

1658	pauxi is a monogamous species, with only a single case of. They prefer to venture out in the open and feed on the lake from dusk til dawn, although there seems to be marked variation from year to year according to the availability of food items..\r\n	9095520191	2010-03-26 22:13:24
1501	If subfamilies are to be accepted in the Phalacrocoracidae, the Pelagic Shag and its relatives would go in the Phalacrocoracinae like most Northern Hemisphere cormorants and shags, while Leucocarboninae would include mainly Southern Hemisphere taxa.. Typical measurements of the wing are 4546 cm (1818 in) in males, 37.544 cm (14.817.3 in) in females; the bill is about 8.79.8 cm (3.43.9 in) long in males and 7.58.5 cm (3.03.3 in) in females. Species preyed on include the North American Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) on Santa Rosa Island and the Santa Cruz Islands, the Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus) in northern Sweden, the Brown Rat (Rattus norvegicus) in the northern highlands of Scotland, Great Gerbils (Rhombomys opimus) in the Caspian Sea region of Kazahkstan, and grass rats (especially Blick s grass rat, Arvicanthis blicki) and the Big-headed mole rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) in the Bale Mountains..\r\n	4885797917	2009-09-25 11:29:20
1502	Cackling Geese have occasionally reached western Europe naturally, as has been proved by ringing recoveries. Females are slightly larger at 47 to 61 cm (19 to 24 in) in length and a mean weight of 700 g (1.5 lb). This adaptation allows for an efficient nutrient and oxygen transport throughout the body, providing birds with energy to fly and maintain high levels of activity.\r\n	7956887761	2010-07-14 12:54:41
1503	A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt. The Black-eared Wood Quail (Odontophorus melanotis) is a species of bird in the Odontophoridae family. The management of sharp-tailed grouse habitat has changed over the years from observational (making sure current habitat is maintained) to more hands on approach.\r\n	4598698948	2009-04-23 11:42:58
1504	The Black-browed Albatross is a medium-sized albatross, at 8095 cm (3137 in) long with a 200240 cm (7994 in) wingspan and an average weight of 2.94.7 kg (6.410.4 lb). On the other hand, as evidenced by the etymology of  anhinga  detailed above, the Tupi seem to have considered the Anhinga a kind of Bird of Ill Omen.. These wetlands are attractive due to a dominance of open vegetation, large concentrations of prey, and the general absence of human disturbance.\r\n	3640984910	2010-11-19 22:34:16
1505	Pairs call frequently as a pair, both to reinforce the pair bond and warn intruders away from their territory. In addition to these three species, a number of systematically enigmatic species and genera have been considered potential members of this family. Most Puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs.\r\n	9807906951	2010-08-11 21:43:11
1506	Among standard measurements, the wing bone is 2835 cm (1114 in) long, the tail is 1624 cm (6.39.4 in) long and the tarsus is 7.59 cm (3.03.5 in). do not currently have problems with bird. It is a resident breeder in tropical lowland forests, rivers-edge forests, lowland evergreen forest, secondary forest, and lowland shrublands at an altitude of 2,000 m (6,600 ft).\r\n	7558444960	2010-11-13 14:10:10
1507	Early mortality can be due to natural causes, relating to harsh weather conditions, or more often starvation. Conrad Gessner is given by Linnaeus as a source, but the Historiae animalium mentions the Muscovy Duck only in passing. The proposed subspecies jankowskii was for some time placed on CITES Appendix II; it was eventually removed since it is not generally accepted as valid..\r\n	6351476621	2010-02-14 18:23:15
1508	The most atypical bill is owned by the Boat-billed Heron, which has a broad thick bill. Traditional means of capture varied across the birds  range and nets and rods were used in various ingenious ways. Sheep are sometimes eaten in considerable numbers, especially in the Inner and Outer Hebrides of Scotland (25.9% and 26.8% of nest remains respectively).\r\n	4552020616	2009-01-19 10:58:28
1509	Hence, in this case the scientific name Buteo melanoleucus can apply to the Black-chested Eagle-buzzard, even though the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle was described under exactly that name earlier, while the senior homonym melanoleucus still applies to the latter species when placed in Spizaetus according to the usual ICZN rules. It resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages. In Oklahoma pinyon-juniper habitats, Scaled Quail use the shade of tree cholla (Cylindropuntia imbricata) and human-made structures.\r\n	8822867786	2010-10-20 11:52:30
1510	Each bird seems to require a hunting territory of about 3,500 acres (1,400 hectars) at least. Most burrow nesting species dig a horizontal tunnel into a vertical (or nearly vertical) dirt cliff, with a chamber at the tunnel s end to house the eggs. However, the flocks of the species are not stable social units but rather groups that ensure greater safety in numbers and collectively draw each other s attention to ideal foraging and roosting sites.\r\n	7657791380	2010-04-16 15:27:35
1511	The Chimney Swift starts by dabbing two globs of saliva onto the wall of a chimney or tree trunk. Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather. It is strictly pelagic outside the breeding season, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes Swinhoe s Petrel a difficult bird to see from land.\r\n	7701333319	2010-09-11 11:17:31
1512	The Maguari Stork (Ciconia maguari) is a species of stork in the Ciconiidae family. alboaxillaris only), and a long curved bill (longest in the adult female) with a kink rather than a smooth curve. In the extreme southeast and southwest of the breeding range  the Rocky Mountains region of the northwestern USA and the southern Great Lakes  Lesser Scaup are present all-year; it is not clear whether the breeding birds are replaced by migrants from the far north in winter, or whether the local populations do not migrate, or whether both local and migrant birds are found there in winter..\r\n	8480005406	2009-08-26 20:26:17
1513	To achieve this goal, biologists plan to establish at least five populations on a combination of predator-free Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and predator-controlled sites on Main Hawaiian Islands. Cavity-dwelling species have to contend with the danger of predators accessing their nest, catching them and their young inside and unable to get out. In addition to fish, they take a wide range of other aquatic prey, such as molluscs, crustaceans, worms, insect larvae, and amphibians; more rarely, small mammals and birds may be taken.\r\n	6201763909	2009-10-11 21:12:13
1514	It is extinct or threatened in many locations due to habitat loss. The Common Buzzard breeds in woodlands, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land.

1519	Displaying males usually make a wheezy  pee-wit, wit wit, eeze wit  during their display flight, these birds also make squeaking or mewing sounds.. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. The average home range estimate for this hawk is 1 to 2 square miles (2.5 to 5 km).\r\n	7772535560	2010-04-19 11:16:20
1520	When breeding, they mainly choose coral atolls with low shrubs, nesting underneath them (or occasionally in limestone cavities). The short black tail has 2-3 white bands. For example, a gull whose most efficient loiter airspeed was 22 mph could fly at anything between 15 and 28 mph without increasing its metabolic rate more than 15 percent..\r\n	3304498534	2010-04-15 17:58:15

Relatively few studies have focused on the flamingo respiratory system, however little to no divergences from the standard avian anatomical design have occurred in their evolutionary history.\r\n	8961592283	2010-09-18 17:22:37
1522	In accordance with the treatment there, the Imperial Shag complex is here left unsplit as well, but the King Shag complex has been.. Another recent experimental approach was recording the bird s song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed auditory feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable). Snowcock will often weigh 2.5 to 3 kg (5.5 to 6.6 lb), whereas the female and male adult turkey weigh around 4 kg (8.8 lb) and 8 kg (18 lb), respectively.\r\n	5630729925	2010-02-18 13:37:14
1523	The loud calls of the birds are commonly heard early in the mornings. Its range was formerly more extensive, but over-hunting has reduced its distribution and numbers. Further information: Lung#Avian lungs.\r\n	3949309311	2009-02-13 17:16:16
1524	The eggs hatch together after 1920 days, and the precocial chicks leave the nest within a day or two. Total incubation time is around 3945 days. Gyrfalcons, skuas, and Buteos like Rough-legged Buzzards, which are normally fierce competitors with each other, have worked together to group-mob Golden Eagles that have passed their adjacent nesting areas.\r\n	2966455759	2009-12-25 22:39:51
1525	The overall impression of standing birds is gray, with flying birds showing conspicuous white rear parts (lower back, belly, and tail). The face, throat and breast are heavily spotted black, and there are also some streaks on the rear belly. They are 1723 cm long, but the females are larger than the males.\r\n	8006145015	2009-01-15 16:33:46
1526	They are shorter legged and longer winged than Little Stint. The Galpagos Petrel (Pterodroma phaeopygia) is a large, long-winged gadfly petrel. Ring-necked Pheasant is both the name used for the species as a whole in North America and also the collective name for a number of subspecies and their intergrades which have white neck rings..\r\n	7652554987	2009-05-26 21:26:35
1527	The tallest bird ever however was the Giant Moa (Dinornis maximus), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 CE. The females are darker with coarser barring on wing-coverts and breast, and grey flanks.. The legs are strong for Procellariiformes, in fact, almost uniquely amongst the order in that they and the giant petrels are able to walk well on land..\r\n	0294083848	2009-02-16 11:35:22
1528	brachyrhynchus) has the bill short, bright pink in the middle, and the feet also pink, the upper wing-coverts being nearly of the same bluish-grey as in the Greylag Goose. Scaled Quail in Oklahoma inhabit rough or rolling land, especially where sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), mesquite, cactus (Opuntia spp. Gieson and Connelly (1993) reported that Colombian sharp-tailed grouse (T.p.columbianus) selected for dense shrub stands with taller, denser shrubs located at the nest site.\r\n	9856239590	2010-07-27 17:32:57
1529	Clearly, there can be safety in numbers, but there is some doubt about whether it balances out against the tendency for conspicuous breeding colonies to attract predators, and some suggest that colonial breeding can actually make birds more vulnerable. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the King Vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses as its bill is not strong enough to do this. The calls overhead from large groups of Cackling Geese flying in V-shaped formation signal the transitions into spring and fall.\r\n	6681936995	2009-06-17 11:15:52
1530	Sometimes the factors are finely balanced. The first flamingo hatched in a European zoo was a Chilean Flamingo at Zoo Basel (Switzerland) in 1958. A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water.\r\n	8553027847	2009-05-19 20:21:35
1531	The social communication by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. It is thus only slightly smaller than the Great Blue or Grey Heron (A.\r\n	9707338679	2010-04-16 16:13:45

1533	The Orinoco Goose (Neochen jubata) is a member of the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae. The species is 50 to 65 cm (20 to 26 in) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 1.121.36 m (3.74.5 ft). But populations have recovered well after stricter environmental protection laws came into effect, and are stable or slightly increasing today.\r\n	5205502440	2009-05-26 23:12:53
1534	They will also consume snails, worms, small crabs, fish, mollusks, and seeds. Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline is a continuation of trend towards range contraction that has occurred over the last two centuries. It has a slow flight, with its long neck retracted (S-shaped).\r\n	4981064674	2010-05-19 18:13:13
1535	A pair may mate for life (up to around 20 years). Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. Birds can fly at altitudes that would be impossible for bats, since bird lungs can extract a larger fraction of oxygen from the air than can mammal lungs..\r\n	5386073457	2010-06-12 14:34:46
1660	This species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac.\r\n	1181523244	2009-10-16 16:39:50
1536	Consequently, feathers can become waterlogged, making the bird barely buoyant. The cygnets (juveniles) are grey in appearance, becoming white after the first year.. The Rufous-vented Chachalaca (Ortalis ruficauda) is a member of an ancient group of birds of the Cracidae family, which are related to the Australasian mound builders.\r\n	6619052181	2009-06-24 16:16:45
1537	Around that time, the pond was dominated by Falcated Ducks roosting there. Like most Tinamous, it will place its nest on the ground alongside raised roots. This Tinamou and the Thicket Tinamou will produce hybrids on occasion..\r\n	2039338718	2010-04-21 12:51:46
1538	Its population has since rebounded and it is probably the most common gull in North America. This Action Plan provides a status survey and recommendations for future action for Cracids.. The female, less colourful, has a white eye-ring and a whitish throat.\r\n	9430292430	2010-11-11 16:25:18
1539	The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. These three species are a group of smallish shanks with red or yellowish legs, a breeding plumage that is generally subdued light brown above with some darker mottling and with a pattern of somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck.. Bird song is best developed in the order Passeriformes.\r\n	9215848595	2009-04-16 22:48:13
1540	It has been seen that the medulla, hypothalamus and mid-brain are involved in the control of panting, as well through the Hering-Breuer reflex that uses stretch receptors in the lungs, and the vagus nerve. Given that most albatross ringing projects are considerably younger than that, it is thought likely that other species will prove to live that long and even longer.. Sometimes the cob will use his wings to run faster and appear larger in order to scare away a predator..\r\n	9187319482	2009-04-23 20:55:55
1541	The subspecies fostersmithi inhabits the Llanos and the Orinoco basin of Colombia and Venezuela. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is less broad and is dark-grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. The males also select for upland or midland habitat type on the tops of ridges or hills (Manske and Barker 1987).\r\n	3598387027	2010-03-12 15:29:49
1542	Thus, thorough molecular phylogenetic studies would be required to resolve the question of subspecies delimitation.. The Nene is the world s rarest goose. This problem is also evident for the pink-footed goose..\r\n	4721716521	2010-11-23 16:25:29

1544	At any rate, both light and dark birds are today treated as a single species, with five of the junior synonyms referring to the dark form. After about one week of courtship and nest-building, the female lays a clutch of usually 2 or 3 eggs, sometimes just 1, sometimes up to 6.. As other chachalacas, the Rufous-vented Chachalaca is a very noisy species, preferring to execute their vocal feats at dawn.\r\n	3080595114	2010-07-20 12:24:41
1545	Most sightings in southern Florida are usually considered to be escapees, although at least one bird banded as a chick in the Yucatn Peninsula has been sighted in Everglades National Park, and others may be vagrant birds from Cuba. It is popular in wildfowl collections, and escapees are frequently seen in a semi-wild condition in Europe. It has been observed to regularly consume fruit in Central America.\r\n	2853461622	2009-06-18 11:36:36
1546	The whitish down continues until around 25 days of age, at which point it is gradually replaced by dark contour feathers that eclipse the down and the birds attain a general piebald appearance. Adults always have yellow eyes and the all-dark tail is noticeably shorter than in the Snail Kite. The Wattled Jacana lays four black-marked brown eggs in a floating nest.\r\n	8409526907	2010-04-21 17:42:56
1547	Golden Eagles use their agility and speed combined with extremely powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).. Among the Aquila genus, only the long-winged and tailed Wedge-tailed Eagle (A. Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics has usually given Hexapoda the rank of superclass,:180 and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as Entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts.\r\n	4841604296	2010-10-18 15:48:37

Most of these colour variants are also known in domestic Mallards not bred as livestock, but kept as pets, aviary birds, etc., where they are rare but increasing in availability.. The Turkey Vulture is awkward on the ground with an ungainly, hopping walk.\r\n	8922795148	2010-11-15 21:39:32
1549	This species has been noted for its rather aggressive temperament, which has been regularly directed at humans when the birds are held in captivity. It winters in Ireland and western Scotland.. In Finland, most banded juveniles move between 1,000 and 2,000 km (620 and 1,240 mi) due south, whereas adults stay locally through winter.\r\n	0754600030	2010-08-18 12:23:24

Some believe that it may have laid its eggs in the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.. hendersoni has a reddish belly and spotted flanks.. versicolor) of Japan is sometimes placed as subspecies within the Common Pheasant.\r\n	4718160948	2010-07-16 21:50:41
1552	Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 25.7 to 30.6 cm (10.1 to 12.0 in), the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm (1.7 to 2.4 in) and the tarsus is 4.1 to 4.8 cm (1.6 to 1.9 in). Four pale green eggs are laid between March and May.. Successful introductions include Haleakala and Pi?iholo ranches on Maui. The typical contact call is a loud, shrill  pee-wit  from which they get their other name of Peewit.\r\n	9100628664	2010-09-16 22:14:53
1553	With these two as subspecies of the Kalij Pheasant, the Silver Pheasant has 15 subspecies. Boobies are another group of seabirds known for their mating displays. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical swamps.. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight.\r\n	7060408528	2009-02-25 17:53:15
1554	Fledging occurs after 103115 days, after which the chick is independent of the adult.. The main threat to the species, and the primary reason for its decline in the Western Palearctic, comes from habitat loss and degradation, as a result of dam construction, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, and drainage of wetlands. The initial flight for the males is taken at 38 to 40 days while the slower-developing females fly about 10 days later. The Turkey Vulture received its common name from the resemblance of the adult s bald red head and its dark plumage to that of the male Wild Turkey, while the name  vulture  is derived from the Latin word vulturus, meaning  tearer,  and is a reference to its feeding habits.\r\n	3511368280	2010-02-24 19:41:57
1555	The modern winter habitat of the species is cultivated fields, where it feeds on barley, rice and wheat, and may damage crops. The Pearl Kite feeds mainly on lizards, especially Anolis, but also takes small birds and insects; it usually sits on a high open perch from which it swoops on its prey. This grebe does not have webbed feet. It harasses Puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up..\r\n	5004664443	2010-12-13 23:19:21
1556	Juveniles are brown above with two whitish  V  shapes on the back. Thanks to its habit of perching among the reeds, the Least Bittern can feed from the surface of water that would be too deep for the wading strategy of other herons. In non-breeding condition the long downcurved bill and long legs are bright red-orange. Masked Ducks breed in any freshwater water body with marsh vegetation and surrounded by heavy tree cover.\r\n	9795742809	2010-04-11 15:20:35
1557	 one recognizes the order by the single behavioral characteristic, namely that in drinking the water is pumped up by peristalsis of the esophagus which occurs without exception within the order. It further revealed that, contrary to what was initially believed, female Spot-billed Ducks do not seem to prefer the brightly colored Mallard drakes to their own species  males, with hybrids being more often than not between Spot-billed Duck drakes and Mallard hens, but this might simply be due to the more strongly vagrant drakes being over-represented in the northwards-expanding population.. AKS (t= 300 000 years) and DL (t=258 000 years) indicate that these populations. The Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) is a bird in the grouse subfamily Tetraoninae of the pheasant family Phasianidae.\r\n	8151826605	2010-09-26 18:29:20
1558	It is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger Turkey Vulture from carcasses.. The song, given at night, is a loud kee-kee-kee.. aequatorialis (left) and nominate (right). Wintering Lesser Scaup are typically found in freshwater or slightly brackish habitat and unlike Greater Scaup rarely are seen offshore when unfrozen freshwater habitat is available.\r\n	9719908724	2009-09-15 23:16:26
1559	Hunting is normally in cover, but, particularly in the wintering areas, it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. The homosexual copulations may attract females to the lek, like the presence of satellite males. It may be that these were kenyoni, but whether the bill color distinguishes the presumed subspecies or whether it is due to a simple mutation has not been determined. The breeding colonies may contain hundreds of birds and are on cliffs in ice-free areas with the birds arriving in October.\r\n	1763270778	2009-11-23 14:11:33
1560	Almost annually and apparently more and more often in recent times, a few birds stray to Alaska and the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands. The Black-shouldered or Japanned mutation was initially considered as a subspecies P. Swainson s Hawks may be largely insectivorous except when nesting. Between three to four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers).\r\n	0802678655	2010-08-16 16:59:35
1561	In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. Alternatively, the genus may be disassembled altogether and in the most extreme case be reduced to the Great, White-breasted and Japanese Cormorants.. Pliny the Elder, in his Historia Naturalis, repeats Aristotle s observations.. Another study found that in orchards,.\r\n	2905439494	2010-11-19 21:42:26
1562	Frugivores are more social than the insectivores, which are more solitary and territorial.. In diving birds, the operculum keeps water out of the nasal cavity; when the birds dive, the impact force of the water closes the operculum. Predation is inadequately documented but may be a factor.. Its natural habitats are freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, coastal saline lagoons, and water storage areas.\r\n	9319712577	2010-08-20 20:34:13
1563	Some members of this group nest colonially in trees, while others, notably the bitterns, use reedbeds.. Most foods are swallowed whole, including most fish and even other gulls. The Laysan Albatross is usually easy to identify. Small numbers of feral birds, derived from escapes from zoo collections, also breed in other north European countries.\r\n	3047606502	2009-07-12 21:32:20
1564	They dive for about 30 seconds and may move to a more secluded area of the water, allowing only the head to be visible to watch the danger dissipate. It is smaller than the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture and has a shorter, thinner tail. It is the only Storm-petrel gray in color.. Males at lek appear to maintain small territories next to each other and they allow females to visit them and make no attempt to guard harems.\r\n	4492106999	2009-09-18 11:56:25
1565	The duck is native to these lands too, and it is likely that it was kept by the Muisca as a domestic animal to some extent. Ducklings are dependent on animal matter such as insects earth worms, leeches, midges and snails. Their preferred habitat for breeding is in swamps and wooded ponds of the northern half of the United States and southern Canada. Canada Geese can cause fatal crashes when they strike an aircraft s engine.\r\n	1678673402	2009-04-21 19:35:54
1566	It periodically occurs in Iowa and rarely in northwestern Missouri, northern Illinois, and southwestern Wisconsin.. Many thousands survived in the core range in Canada and Alaska, however, where populations have since rebounded. This lapwing is the only crested wader in South America. Several species have been recorded as prey, especially in Northern Europe, Slovakia (where owls make up 2.4% of prey remains) and some parts of the Western United States.\r\n	6022860449	2010-05-15 22:43:30
1567	The Lesser Scaup drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. Captive birds have been measured up to a wingspan of 2.81 m (9 ft 3 in) and a mass of 12.1 kg (27 lb) (the latter figure was for an eagle bred for the purposes of falconry which tend to be unnaturally heavy), respectively. This characteristic is also seen in reptiles.. The Roe Deer was also a prominent prey item in the French Pyrenees (14.9%) and Switzerland (14.6%), respectively.\r\n	7565105963	2009-01-16 20:56:13
1568	Nesting begins as soon as suitable foraging and nesting habitat is available. There is typically a septum made of bone or cartilage that separates the two nares, but in some families (including gulls, cranes and New World vultures) the septum is missing. Unfortunately, many birds cannot distinguish the difference between real sky and a reflection of the sky in a window.. The White-faced Whistling Duck is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies..\r\n	5459580700	2010-04-20 11:38:10
1569	They defend the females and young but not the nest sites. Like the other mergansers, these fish-feeding ducks have serrated edges to their bills to help them grip their prey; they are therefore often known as  sawbills . seconds at 55 and 60 seconds at 72. In Eastern Europe, the race is found from Estonia to Romania, Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria in southeastern Europe.\r\n	9092427596	2010-04-17 21:51:48
1659	The American Oystercatcher is found on the Atlantic coast of North America from New England to northern Florida, where it is also found on the Gulf coast, and south to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Male Mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species, and even each other, in the same way.\r\n	3022031234	2010-01-22 18:35:50
1570	An approach to identify migration intensity makes use of upward pointing microphones to record the nocturnal contact calls of flocks flying overhead. The Pintail or Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) is a duck with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe, Asia and North America. The pen (female) lays and incubates a clutch of 27 (usually 35) eggs, watching for danger while sitting on the nest.

1571	Like other forest creatures, the ruffed grouse will maintain trails through the underbrush and pines. Kansas and Oklahoma to northern Florida. Their loud calls make them easy to detect, and in forest areas often indicate the presence of a predator such as a tiger. The Roald Dahl novel Danny the Champion of the World dealt with a poacher (and his son) who lived in the United Kingdom and illegally hunted Common Pheasants..\r\n	6738270264	2010-03-11 15:52:46
1572	It measures 114132 cm (4552 in) in length, 97120 cm (3847 in) tall and 160180 cm (6371 in) across the wings. In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at Embalse Cerrn Grande, Laguna El Jocotal, and especially Lago de Gija. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. The albatross diet is predominantly cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal, although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton.\r\n	5484895541	2009-11-19 10:46:57
1573	Many Hindu deities are associated with the bird, Krishna is often depicted with a feather in his headband, while worshippers of Shiva associate the bird as the steed of the God of war, Karthikeya (also known as Skanda or Murugan). Although this seabird once breed on cliffs in the mountains of the Greater Antilles, only three confirmed breeding sites remain, all in the high mountains of Hispaniola (at Lomo de Toro in the Dominican Republic, and in Parc La Visite and Parc Macaya on Haitian side of the island). The base of the Horned Coot s enormous nest is a mound built of stones, gathered one at a time by the pair, using their beaks. Although 85 chicks from the 289 Whooping Crane eggs transplanted into Sandhill Crane nests learned to migrate, the Whooping Cranes failed to mate with other Whooping Cranes due to imprinting on their Sandhill foster parents; the project was discontinued in 1989.\r\n	6219739314	2010-12-17 10:55:27
1574	Mainly white underneath, they have black wingtips and shoulders. The newly established population on Midway lays larger clutches, presumably because of better availability of food. Many seabirds have glands near the eyes that allow them to drink seawater. In spite of differences in the mouth, foot morphology and nesting habits they remained in the family until a 2000 study moved them to a separate family closer to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae).\r\n	7955385427	2009-03-13 18:31:25

Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.. The breeding season of the Little Tinamou ranges from May to October. Recent molecular evidence now places the species with the fantails..\r\n	4221094015	2009-03-15 17:29:40
1576	Scientists have had a hard time measuring how fast a bird can fly, due in part to the variable effects of wind. In 2004, the population grew to an estimated 576 ducks.. As with body size bill size varies between the sexes, although species where the females have larger bills than the male are more common, particularly in the insect eating species.. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers.\r\n	8260479097	2009-05-26 16:22:10
1577	Darwin developed a second principle of sexual selection to resolve the problem, though in the prevailing intellectual trends of Victorian Britain, the theory failed to gain widespread attention. He placed a camera in the center of the breeding ground at a height of 3 feet. and 35 million in the United Kingdom.. Considering that that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of Golden Eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles.\r\n	6863882415	2009-10-17 11:45:54
1578	The whitish down continues until around 25 days of age, at which point it is gradually replaced by dark contour feathers that eclipse the down and the birds attain a general piebald appearance. Ammann (1957) found that leks that contained woody vegetation did not exceed 30% of the total lek area. In Nepal, its distribution is restricted to the western lowland plains, with most of the population occurring in Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, and Nawalparasi districts..

The largest species is Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) of the sub-Antarctic oceans, which also has the largest wingspan of any living bird. It is difficult to distinguish from the closely related Grey-headed Albatross and Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross, the latter with which it was long considered conspecific and is still considered by some a subspecies of.\r\n	2863221341	2009-04-13 13:30:57
1580	When migrating, however, birds often do climb to relatively great heights, possibly to avoid dehydration in the warmer air near the ground. Snail Kites have been observed eating other prey items in Florida, including crayfish in the genus Procambarus and Black Crappie. Some investigators have posited a model in which the connection between LMAN and RA carries an instructive signal based on evaluation of auditory feedback (comparing the bird s own song to the memorized song template), which adaptively alters the motor program for song output. It is found along the east coast of North America, the coasts and some islands of the Caribbean, and across northern South America to eastern Brazil.\r\n	8639462065	2010-02-26 20:15:54
1581	They alternate groups of stiff, shallow wingbeats with glides.. Ardea herodias wardi Ridgway, 1882. Scaled Quail occupy desert grassland or desert scrub with a minimum of one loafing covert per approximately 70 acres (28 ha). Its body plumage is mainly grey.\r\n	5639539865	2009-12-17 20:41:51
1582	Whiskered Auklets lay a single egg in a rocky crevice, in loose colonies with other Whiskered Auklets and also other colonial seabirds. The upperparts are glossy blue-black upperparts, with bluish and greenish iridescence especially prominent on the secondaries (lower arm feathers). Considering that that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of Golden Eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles. The male has a clear whistle that sounds like:  pjiew pjiew , whereas the female has a low growl :  rawr ..\r\n	7356800622	2010-04-26 11:51:14
1583	This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.. The heart of the breeding population for the species is in Russia, however, where possibly up to 100,000 cranes of this species can be found seasonally. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of terns and other seabirds. The call of the Tiny Hawk is a shrill, high-pitched, somewhat quavery series of 2030 notes of uneven pitch.\r\n	3078677533	2010-12-26 16:55:40

The smaller second eggs contained less yolk concentration, which could influence embryo development, hatching success, and subsequent chick growth and survival. The Frisian exception was removed in 2005 by a court, which determined that the Frisian executive councillors had not properly followed procedure.\r\n	7987068147	2009-05-21 18:58:24
1585	Additionally affecting the Red-shouldered Hawk was the greater availability of firearms in the early 1900s, leading to unchecked hunting of this and all other raptor species until conservation laws took effect in the latter half of the 20th century. This is a frequent cause of death for chicks of birds that are breeding for the first time. The eggs are whitish with bold splotches of reddish-brown and are about 6.2 cm  4.5 cm (2.4 in  1.8 in) and weigh about 65 g (2.3 oz). In the earliest works of science, a species was simply an individual organism that represented a group of similar or nearly identical organisms.\r\n	7980989365	2010-09-14 12:30:53
1586	Unfortunately, many birds cannot distinguish the difference between real sky and a reflection of the sky in a window.. They sleep on their parents  backs. Their legs and feet are orange-yellow.. They mainly eat berries, acorns, and seeds, but also insects, making them omnivores..\r\n	6703911814	2010-06-20 16:18:44
1587	For the experienced falconer it offers an opportunity to experience the nearest equivalent to hunting with the Golden Eagle with much lower risk of injury to the falconer by the hawk. This species breeds colonially in marshes, usually nesting in bushes or low trees. The study identified five clades within the family, and placed the split between the first clade, which contains the monogamous manucodes and Paradise-crow, and all the other birds-of-paradise, to be 10 million years ago. Though the majority of domestic geese are descended from the Greylag Goose (A.\r\n	6557754955	2010-10-17 17:13:22
1588	The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with vegetation, into which typically 4 eggs are laid and incubated by the male and female parents. The process may take several months, and a single pair may start several excavations before finding a tree or stump with wood of the right consistency.. The Australian Magpie is particularly well known for this behavior.. The bird s average length is 2628 cm, with a wingspan of 3540 cm.\r\n	0666045269	2010-06-12 16:22:39
1589	Bergmann s Rule, which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates, has numerous examples in birds. Average clutch size on Laysan Island is approximately four eggs. It is estimated that the adult survival rate is reduced by 3 to 5% in Scotland by intentional poisonings. Although both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World Vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world.\r\n	2785170059	2010-02-24 14:47:36
1590	The upperparts are greyish-brown, with thin light fringes to the larger feathers and a maroon hindneck and cap (reaching just below the eye). In one observation, an adult Great Black-back was seen to rob a female Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) of a freshly caught Gadwall (Anas strepera). No comprehensive range of weights are known for the largest subspecies (A. This tendency to return to their point of origin to breed is so strong that a study of Laysan Albatross showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m (72 ft)..\r\n	3493117421	2010-03-15 13:15:25
1591	Other species in that family include woodcocks, phalaropes, snipes, and sandpipers. It is a medium sized francolin with males averaging 11.613.4 in (2934 cm) and females averaging 10.211.9 in (2630 cm). Many tinamous lay their eggs on a shallow mat of dead leaves they have collected and placed under bushes or between the root buttresses of trees, and Kagus lay theirs on a pile of dead leaves against a log, tree trunk or vegetation. The War of the Pacific, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits..\r\n	8664331004	2009-07-11 22:34:50
1592	Little can be said of the evolutionary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The Greater Scaup drake s eclipse plumage looks similar to its breeding plumage, except the pale parts of the plumage are a buffy gray. In the tropics there is little variation in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply (although because of competition, there may not be enough food for every bird). These neurons were first discovered in macaque monkeys, but recent research suggests that mirror neuron systems may be present in other animals including humans..\r\n	8438389404	2009-03-22 11:27:25

Krill and other crustaceans are the most important component of the diet but the species also feeds on small fish such as the Antarctic silverfish and squid such as Psychroteuthis, Gonatus and Galiteuthis. Four subspecies are usually recognized, one of which has recently been given full species status (see below). painted tiles with design of birds from Qajar dynasty.\r\n	2825932232	2010-01-23 10:21:26
1594	However, Swainson s Hawk has a slightly longer wingspan at 117137 cm (4654 in), with more slender, elongated wings, than the Red-tailed Hawk. The color of the bill varied from white in the spring to brown in other seasons. The plumage has been described as being similar in appearance to the colouring of a Siamese cat. Cladistic analysis suggests that it is related to other cliff-nesting species such as the Red-footed Shag, Pelagic cormorant and Red-faced Shag..\r\n	1648962790	2009-08-16 12:14:28
1595	Researchers have analysed calls of Blue-footed Boobies and conducted playback experiments. The same location may be used for several years and both members of the pair help build the nest. Males gather on the lek or strutting grounds, which are small open areas where breeding occurs, in late February to April, as soon as the lek is relatively free of snow.

1599	As in most Accipiters, the tarsus is relatively long, measuring 5.67.6 cm (2.23.0 in) long, and the bill is relatively small, with the culmen from the cere measuring only 1.52.1 cm (0.590.83 in). It has a loud cackling call, HOOOOOONK!, like the domestic goose.. The best distinction is the call; Grey-tailed has a disyllabic whistle, and Wandering a rippling trill.. Compensating farmers for crop losses has been suggested as a measure that may help.\r\n	9820902781	2009-02-21 12:50:34
1600	As opposed to Golden Eagles found further east in Eurasia, the adults of this race are a tawny golden-brown on the upper-side. It is the only known species of the genus Sarkidiornis. Adults are 2838 cm (1115 in) long with a 7684 cm (3033 in) wingspan and a body mass of 162270 g (5.79.5 oz).\r\n	6628559516	2009-04-23 17:41:57

Lizards turn up with some regularity as prey in some of the hotter, drier portions of the Golden Eagles range.\r\n	6319790446	2010-08-23 10:30:13
1602	In Western Europe, Golden Eagle habitat is dominated by open, rough grassland, heath and bogs, in places enlivened by rocky ridges, spurs, crags, scree, slopes and grand plateaux. Although eiderdown pillows or quilts are now a rarity, eiderdown harvesting continues and is sustainable, as it can be done after the ducklings leave the nest with no harm to the birds.. Studies have shown that Cattle Egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly.\r\n	8749490412	2009-01-16 19:43:29
1603	Contrary to its common name, the ground calls of the Whistling Swan are not a whistle and neither notably different from that of Bewick s Swan. There are indications that the breeding success is decreasing, but why this is so remains puzzling. Within Great Britain, the most important wintering areas are in Norfolk (147,000 in 2004), Lancashire (44,000 in 2004), and Aberdeenshire (primarily on autumn and spring passage).\r\n	6267642176	2009-09-26 19:52:37
1604	At about 22 cm (8.75 in), it is one of the shortest quails of North America, although it weighs 180 g (6 oz), the same as some Callipepla quails that are several centimetres longer. In breeding plumage, the latter has a distinctive red face, throat and breast. It is thought to be ancestral to the domestic chicken, with some hybridzation with the Grey Junglefowl.\r\n	3938878818	2009-01-19 20:36:26
1605	In some species such as Zebra Finches, learning of song is limited to the first year; they are termed  age-limited  or  close-ended  learners. The juveniles are brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes.. Black-shouldered Kites are most often seen hunting over grassy roadside verges..\r\n	6470427777	2010-04-25 18:54:25

1610	The eye occupies a considerable part of the skull and is surrounded by a sclerotic eye-ring, a ring of tiny bones that surround the eye. Within two weeks the tan down has been replaced by white down. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single ossifications, such as the pygostyle.\r\n	3333658114	2009-10-27 12:54:43
1611	The Chinese Bamboo Partridge is a small bird, intermediate in size between the Coturnix and Perdix species, reaching a size of 100 cm, with males being slightly larger than females. It is difficult to distinguish from the closely related Grey-headed Albatross and Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross, the latter with which it was long considered conspecific and is still considered by some a subspecies of.

1612	Standing up to 1.53 m (5.0 ft), with a wingspan of up to 2.3 m (7.5 ft) and a weight up to 5 kg (11 lb) is the AfricanGoliath Heron (Ardea goliath), the largest of the diverse and well-known herons and egrets. The speculum feathers are greenish-blue, bordered on both sides by white. If Dodos were this light, the Rodrigues solitaire may have been larger.\r\n	1805736304	2009-09-22 15:14:20
1613	The only other bird known to spend days and nights on the wing is the Common Swift.. Adults are about 19 inches (480 mm) in length.. In pigeons, the operculum has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits at the base of the bill, above the nares; though it is sometimes referred to as the cere, this is a different structure.\r\n	3595078266	2009-06-25 14:37:32
1614	In Norway, the number of greylag geese is estimated to have increased three- to fivefold during the last 1520 years. In winter plumage identification is difficult, although it is shorter legged and longer winged than the Little Stint. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds.\r\n	9514871417	2010-10-13 15:17:11
1615	Bird s feet are classified as anisodactyl, zygodactyl, heterodactyl, syndactyl or pamprodactyl. The short, sturdy bills of the Pterodroma species in this group, about 35 altogether, are adapted for soft prey taken at the surface; they have twisted intestines for digesting marine animals which have unusual biochemistries.. There is seldom sexual dimorphism in plumage, when it occurs the males are brighter or the females resemble juveniles.\r\n	0497105455	2009-08-19 10:48:13
1634	Among North America s duck species, northern shovelers trail only mallards and blue-winged teal in overall abundance. However, as this agrees quite well with the fossil evidence some unite the Anhingidae and Phalacrocoracidae in a superfamily Phalacrocoracoidea.. small songbirds may migrate north in the spring, flying directly over the Gulf of Mexico to the coastlines of Texas and other Gulf Coast states.\r\n	4103118380	2010-11-16 22:54:58
1616	By the 1950s, the Little Egret had become restricted to southern Europe, and conservation laws protecting the species were introduced. In mammals, the kidneys and urinary bladder are the primary organs used to control osmoregulation; birds, however, lack a urinary bladder and must compensate for this and they do so through the of mechanisms of these three systems.. birds follow the facetious advice often given to pilots --  fly low and slow.  Most cruise speeds are in the 20-to-30-mph range, with an eider duck having the fastest accurately clocked air speed of about 47 mph.\r\n	4189473890	2010-04-18 20:43:15
1617	It can be differentiated from the Indian Yellow-nosed by its darker head. While the flights are not as long as other migratory birds flamingos still fly for periods without eating.. It has a loud trumpeting call, given in flight and display.\r\n	2407615474	2009-12-14 17:10:30
1618	Males are rather variable depending on the subspecies involved, but all have an at least partially glossy bluish-black plumage, while females are overall brownish. In the French Alps, the most significant prey species is the Alpine Marmot (Marmota marmota) at 68.9% out of a sampling of 198 from 6 nests. The Crested Eagle seems to be a still-hunter, as it has been observed perched for long periods of time while visual scanning the forest around them..\r\n	0474504102	2009-11-12 22:11:49

Young Whooping Cranes completing their first migration, from Wisconsin to Florida, in January 2009, following an ultralight aircraft. A 2004 molecular study of cytochrome-b DNA sequences shows them to have split off from typical hawks and eagles at an earlier date than the Osprey, which has been classified in its own family..\r\n	8267452793	2010-07-25 22:46:15
1620	Due in part to the interbreeding of various migratory subspecies with the introduced non-migratory Giant subspecies, Canada Geese are frequently a year-around feature of such urban environments.. Flightless birds include ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. They mainly eat insects, mollusks, crustaceans and marine worms, but also eat some plant material..\r\n	9668918888	2010-12-16 14:58:54
1621	This is perhaps due to the relative inability of young B-chicks to defend themselves against an A-chick attack.. The lower mandible is supported by a bone known as the inferior maxillary bonea compound bone composed of two distinct ossified pieces. Although wigeon are found in each flyway, they are most numerous in the Pacific Flyway.\r\n	0492363591	2009-11-14 16:21:36

1624	Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Records of single egg clutches are fairly common in Europe, with 3 being rare there but seemingly more common in North America, where up to 12% of clutches include 3 eggs. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching..\r\n	8239839537	2009-04-15 18:54:48
1625	Evidence for this includes quail individuals exhibiting preferential choice of sucrose containing solutions over simple distilled water and the avoidance of salty solutions.. As a result, the Andean flamingos are threatened species.. Prey is first sighted when the Osprey is 1040 m (33131 ft) above the water, after which the bird hovers momentarily then plunges feet first into the water..\r\n	4736269378	2010-09-20 11:52:14

1630	The cob is also responsible for defending the cygnets while on the water, and will sometimes attack small watercraft, such as canoes, that it feels are a threat to its young. Individuals of non-migratory populations abandon their territories after breeding season to roam about the region. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa (Japan) actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds.\r\n	4571871549	2010-12-19 18:46:10
1631	They have raised the question whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.. The food commonly includes agricultural crop plants such as oilseed rape and wheat, and feeding flocks in the winter may cause significant crop damage, often as much through trampling with their large webbed feet, as through direct consumption.. The four grey bars on the tail are distinctive to the Black Hawk-Eagle, as is the white line seen slightly above the bird s eye.\r\n	2174284977	2009-04-17 20:15:41

1723	There are at least two known instances of Scottish White-tailed Eagles fiercely attacking Golden Eagles in apparent territorial bouts, in one instance pulling the Golden down into shallow coastal waters to drown. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair.\r\n	6600007657	2009-05-23 17:14:22
1724	Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.. Very roughly, the subspecies can be divided into two main groups, with the first (subspecies hamiltoni, leucomelanos, melanota, moffitti and lathami) being found in the western and central part of the species  range, while the second (williamsi, oatesi, lineata and crawfurdi) is found in the eastern part.\r\n	8158903864	2009-06-13 12:42:16

Although the current scientific understanding of species suggests that there is no rigorous and comprehensive way to distinguish between different species in all cases, biologists continue to seek concrete ways to operationalize the idea.\r\n	4063686486	2010-12-26 21:38:54
1729	Like most other birds, basic physiological adaptations control both heat loss in warm conditions and heat retention in cooler conditions. The increase and expansion of Great Black-backed Gulls has been attributed to increasing winter fishery activities in the North Sea.\r\n	9888826402	2010-10-22 17:31:32
1730	Theoretical analyses, summarized by Alerstam (2001), show that detours that increase flight distance by up to 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds - a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. In the United States, the Canada Goose is the second most damaging bird strike to airplanes, with the most damaging being turkey vultures.\r\n	4447633384	2009-10-26 15:49:44

1740	The primary food for Great Blue Heron is small fish, though it is also known to opportunistically feed on a wide range of shrimp, crabs, aquatic insects, rodents and other small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and small birds. Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans.\r\n	0695148187	2009-11-10 14:38:15
1741	The species occurs as a (Boreal) summer visitor in the North Pacific Ocean where potentially large numbers are taken as bycatch in fisheries. Males usually attempt to draw attention of approaching predators and will toll (mob terrestrial predators without physical contact) often in accompaniment with males of other goose species.\r\n	8432065137	2010-10-20 12:32:49
1742	The elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking, a head-lowered  cat  display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a  penguin  dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast.. It will also directly attack and kill other seabirds, up to the size of Great Black-backed Gulls.\r\n	5493275347	2010-08-21 16:25:57
1743	It is similar in general appearance to a turkey, with a small head, long strong red legs, and a long broad tail. The Black-capped Petrel is nocturnal at the breeding sites possibly to avoid predation by gulls, hawks or crows.\r\n	4021417701	2009-06-22 12:19:36

1759	Among the Scolopacidae, Xenus is part of the shank-tattler-phalarope clade and less closely related to the calidrid sandpipers. They are now also releasing fledged cranes directly into the established population, to learn the migratory behavior from their peers (Direct Autumn Release). Wherever they are hunted they are always timid once they associate humans with danger, and will quickly retreat for safety after hearing the arrival of hunting parties in the area..\r\n	4475078991	2010-05-22 11:25:45
1760	Less variable in size, the plovers largest species is the Australasian Masked Lapwing (Vanellus miles) at up to 0.4 m (1.3 ft) long, a 0.85 m (2.8 ft) wingspan and a weight of 400 g (14 oz). The nest is a shallow depression scraped in the ground and lined with plants and some down feathers. One description referred to the  wavering  alarm call and  breathy  notes, while other authors describe screams similar to those of the Red-tailed Hawk (B.\r\n	6609497475	2009-04-18 19:19:58
1761	The extended wing bone measures 38.645 cm (15.217.7 in), the shortish tail measures 1621 cm (6.38.3 in) and the relatively long tarsus measures 78.5 cm (2.83.3 in). Leks surrounded by high residual vegetation were observed by Kirsch et al. Aggressive behavior by Golden Eagles due to a human presence near the nest is considered exceptional and usually only result in minor injuries if any, as a particularly bold eagle may rarely attempt to dissuade a human trespasser.\r\n	6598969562	2010-08-23 14:26:28
1762	The Bible also notes migrations, as in the Book of Job (39:26), where the inquiry is made:  Doth the hawk fly by Thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south?  The author of Jeremiah (8:7) wrote:  The stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed time; and the turtledove, and the crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their coming. . Francis Willughby discusses  The Muscovy Duck  as anas moschata and expresses his belief that Aldrovandi s and Gessner s anas cairina, anas indica and anas libyca (which he calls  The Guiny Duck , adding another mistaken place of origin to the list) refer to the very same species. The weight of nominate race individuals is 6.87.8 kg (16 lb), while five adult sharpii averaged 8.4 kg (18.5 lb).\r\n	6334702501	2009-08-14 14:26:18
1763	Studies on starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures.. The species name marila is from the Greek word for charcoal embers or coal dust. Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avian feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first birds were herbivores..\r\n	0505691184	2010-11-19 12:41:55
1764	They will also dig into muddy substrate underwater to extract roots and tubers. This technique is used for solitary or widely dispersed prey found in openings, such as hares or ptarmigans. Cattle Egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species.\r\n	3486907758	2009-10-18 16:47:13
1765	During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called  sub-song , which is akin to babbling in human infants. The status of Choco Tinamou is considered as Vulnerable because it is known from only a few locations within its small range where habitat is gradually disappearing. Around this age, they also start sitting up more.\r\n	8756645829	2009-02-14 10:28:17
1766	Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture. A female will begin to lay eggs in the nest only when the mound s temperature has reached an optimal level.. Females that fail to find additional mates usually help incubate and rear chicks.\r\n	5723456851	2009-03-14 12:52:19
1767	This section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably. Cladistic analysis suggests that it is related to other cliff-nesting species such as the Red-footed Shag, Pelagic cormorant and Red-faced Shag..

1768	The large Himalayan Golden Eagles females are about 37% heavier and nearly 9% longer in wing length than the males of the race compared with the small Japanese Golden Eagles where females are a relatively modest 26% heavier and around 6% longer in wing length than males.. The American green-winged teal winters from southern Alaska and southern British Columbia east to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and south to Central America. Their distribution is patchy, however  they can be seen in the Central Valley and southern coastal areas, open land around Goleta including the Ellwood Mesa Open Space, marshes in Humboldt County, and also around the San Francisco Bay, but elsewhere they are still rare or absent.\r\n	8323161857	2009-01-19 19:36:45
1769	Adult herons, due to their size, have few natural predators, but a few of the larger avian predators have been known to kill both young and adults, including Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) (the only predator known to attack Great Blue Herons at every stage of their life-cycle from in the egg to adulthood), Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and, less frequently, Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) and Harris s Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus). Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Migrating birds in Italy varied their diet according to what was available at each stopover site.\r\n	6930606236	2009-04-11 14:15:49
1770	Its breeding habitat is stony riverbeds in northeast Siberia. It was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns and Erich von Tschermak, who realised that the  inheritable traits  in Darwin s theory are genes.. When all the eggs have hatched, the male will dispose of the remaining egg shells.\r\n	1916104460	2009-03-20 17:16:49
1771	Females have grey on both their legs and feet. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. The former species was placed in Geranoaetus  also a monotypic genus  in 1844, while the Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle had been moved out of Buteo and into Spizastur a few years earlier..\r\n	1124908434	2010-10-26 19:47:42
1772	It is sometimes said to give the impression of a Common Buzzard (which in America would be called a hawk). Thus, the new discoveries might mean that as more data becomes available, the species could be downlisted to Endangered.. A story in the Uttara Ramayana describes the head of the Devas, Indra, who unable to defeat Ravana, sheltered under the wing of peacock and later blessed it with a  thousand eyes  and fearlessness from serpents.\r\n	3628683319	2010-09-14 15:46:31
1773	In Europe it has been known as simply  White-fronted Goose ; in North America it is known as the Greater White-fronted Goose (or  Greater Whitefront ), and this name is also increasingly adopted internationally. Amongst the day herons there is little sexual dimorphism in plumage (except in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent.\r\n	0568108064	2010-03-18 20:25:48
1774	In early fall the male will have a white crescent on each side of the face. It is sometimes separated with other  stints  in Erolia, but, although these apparently form a monophyletic group, the present species  old genus Ereunetes had been proposed before Erolia.. Natural England gives grant aid to help restore lapwing habitat within its Environmental Stewardship Scheme.\r\n	6807678432	2010-02-13 17:41:45
1775	The Black-and-white Hawk-Eagle has been known to attack small monkeys, though it is not clear with which intent. As they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking Manx Shearwater is calculated to have flown 8 million km (5 million miles) during its over-50 year lifespan.. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced to rest on the ocean s surface until the wind picks up again.\r\n	4280289930	2009-11-25 14:46:36
1776	It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles. Fish (such as smelt) may be important locally or seasonally, especially for the American subspecies, and crustaceans can constitute up to 20% of the grebe s diet. The Pacific Coast population has been designated a Threatened species under the Endangered Species Act..\r\n	4060530202	2009-04-24 13:27:52
1777	Occasionally, nests are found on cliffs.. As a result of these unique characteristics, it has been given its own taxonomic genus, Pandion and family, Pandionidae. Education in this region mainly is undertaken by the Royal Society for Protection of Birds (RSPB).\r\n	0416415595	2010-01-23 21:30:39
1778	The Grey Hawk was originally Asturina nitida but controversy existed between ornithologists on whether or not this species was closely enough related enough to put it in the Buteo, but chromosomal mapping in 2013 has proved that the Grey hawk is within the Buteoninae. There are six recognized subspecies:. However, in the Andean countries, they appear to be local residents in foothill forests up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft) elevation or even 1,600 m (5,200 ft)..\r\n	3219661046	2010-05-13 13:28:12
1779	On occasion, Harpy Eagles may also hunt by flying within or above the canopy. The call is a typical sandpiper  peep , and the display song a harsh trill.. Other Buteo hawks in this species range, including smaller-bodied species, do not normally prefer insects in their diet but instead focus on rodents and other small vertebrates.\r\n	5141712545	2010-06-25 14:32:53
1780	This is perhaps due to the relative inability of young B-chicks to defend themselves against an A-chick attack.. It is a member of the family Cathartidae, along with the other six species of New World vultures, and included in the genus Cathartes, along with the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture and the Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture. Non-mated juveniles up to 34 years old also commonly form larger flocks, which can total several hundred birds, often at regular traditional sites.\r\n	8421922645	2010-08-28 11:46:10
1781	The Helmeted Guineafowl is a large (5358 cm) bird with a round body and small head. Dancing is an integral part of courtship, but also may be done at any time of the year.. The first few were brought to Europe by the European explorers at least by the 16th century..\r\n	5084236541	2010-06-26 16:37:43
1782	Males are much larger; they have large red fleshy wattles and comb on the head and long, bright gold and bronze feathers forming a  shawl  or  cape  over the back of the bird from the neck to the lower back. The head is dark grey, and the blackish tail is tipped with pale grey-brown. In the case of raptor nests, or eyries (also spelt aerie), these are often used for many years, with new material added each breeding season.\r\n	4335281249	2010-05-22 19:38:54
1783	Instead, researchers identified a certain degree of tolerance towards the younger sibling during short-term periods of food shortages. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different. Models regarding the real-time error-correction interactions between the AFP and PDP will be considered in the future.\r\n	1948270325	2009-03-12 12:47:50
1784	This overhead cover provides midday shade, but is open at the base to allow easy escape from predators. The male s courtship display involves fluffing out his breast feathers and running after the female; the species has no known aerial display. The blotchy, olive-colored eggs average 2 inches in breadth and 4 inches in length (60 by 100 mm), and weigh about 6.7 oz (190 g).\r\n	1475159282	2010-01-14 20:31:47
1785	Other predators of eggs and young include the Boat-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus major), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, as well as the common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). They are sedentary, or nomadic following food sources. Birds such as jays, trumpeters and guans have been observed to be predated at fruiting trees and male cocks-of-the-rock have been predated while conspicuously performing at their leks.\r\n	2457587415	2010-08-12 15:31:25

The breeding range of the Red-necked Grebe overlaps with that of the Slavonian Grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both.\r\n	0973944692	2010-03-10 10:52:10
1787	They mainly eat vegetation or insects near to the water, consuming animals such as larvae, crustaceans, and mollusks. The male, which plays no part in nesting or chick care, leaves the breeding grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. In some parts of Panama and Guyana, active nests were located 3 km (1.9 mi) away from one another, while they are within 5 km (3.1 mi) of each other in Venezuela.\r\n	7913488881	2010-01-11 21:12:58
1788	It was estimated that the Greater Scaup made up about 11% of the continental Scaup population. It is also found in Asia, and is present in the Aleutian Islands year round. This species has the longest known non-stop migration of any species, up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi)..\r\n	9815219416	2009-07-15 22:35:43

1790	In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The White-faced Ibis occurs in Canada, the United States, Central America and the southern half of South America. Some birds have also been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Maori s legendary Pouakai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans..\r\n	7587759932	2009-04-15 11:26:20
1791	They primarily utter clear whistled  chee, chee, chee  calls in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing  skree-ah  when perched. It is the second most commonly hunted duck in North America, after the mallard.. In the boreal winter, they are pale grey above and white below, like a winter Dunlin, but retaining the head pattern.\r\n	4990087519	2010-06-19 17:51:26
1792	The lined nest is built on tundra close to the sea, and 6-10 eggs are laid.. Swainson s Hawk is generally tolerant of people. The previously mentioned Dromornithidae are now classified as members of this order, making them the largest  waterfowl  that ever lived..\r\n	5492964294	2009-03-27 12:38:56
1793	It is much rarer as a breeding bird, found only in a localised area of the Cairngorms National Park, where 13 pairs have bred since the 1970s. Contrary to its normal migration routine, large flocks of Canada Geese have established permanent residence in Esquimalt, British Columbia, on Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia s James River regions, and in the Triangle area of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill), and nearby Hillsborough. This species is the only one in the genus Oreortyx, which is sometimes included in Callipepla.\r\n	1015844372	2009-11-22 16:16:48
1795	The forelimbs are modified into wings.. Their breeding range is the North Atlantic on coasts influenced by the Gulf Stream. Its long grey bill is an aid to identification.\r\n	6335063373	2010-07-25 17:26:59
1796	In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland s Puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty year ban on hunting was put in place. In 2008 cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland for the first time.. Falcons are medium-size birds of prey with long pointy wings.\r\n	1488818648	2009-03-11 15:27:59
1797	Males will return to the same burrow every year and try to attract another female if their mate does not return or if there is a divorce (about 12% annually) (Bell et al. Pintails in North America at least have been badly affected by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050..\r\n	3533451689	2009-09-17 11:32:58

1799	Experiments in which the necks of chicks were taped to inhibit food ingestion showed that sibling aggression increased sharply when the weight of the A-chicks dropped below 20-25% of their potential. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, where it has been recorded as far west as Great Britain, France and Iceland. ruficauda lamprophonia, Chamaepetes goudotii sanctaemarthae and Penelope argyrotis.\r\n	2433837114	2009-11-23 10:28:55
1800	Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift. The closely related Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) of the Southeast United States and Cuba approached similar sizes at up to 0.5 m (1.6 ft), a 0.78 m (2.6 ft) wingspan and a mass of at least 530 g (1.2 lb). The nominate form from the Indian subcontinent is well marked and differentiated by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary remiges.\r\n	5902156794	2010-08-15 23:19:57

Works that consider the Western Reef Heron as a valid species include the nominate gularis and schistacea as subspecies.. The upper wing-coverts are dark brown, as in the White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) and the Lesser White-fronted Goose (A.\r\n	6570721384	2009-12-18 17:21:19
1803	They have also been recorded from Ireland east to Portugal and Italy, and from France, 13,000 BP (Desbrosse and Mourer-Chauvire 19721973).[full citation needed] The paleosubspecies Cygnus olor bergmanni, which differed only in size from the living bird, is known from fossils found in Azerbaijan.. After the egg is hatched, the female only allows the male to visit when delivering food to the nest. Pair outside burrow on Skomer Island, Wales.\r\n	0529907190	2010-10-18 17:33:21
1804	Usage of the term has spread beyond avian behavior;  billing and cooing  in reference to human courtship (particularly kissing) has been in use since Shakespeare s time, and derives from the courtship of doves.. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. It occurs mainly on the coasts in tropical west Africa, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf (Iran) extending east to India.\r\n	1869320225	2010-09-17 18:31:43

It is especially popular in the province Friesland, but there are also regional competitions. Some care is needed in separating the brown female from the similar Common Teal, but the stronger face markings and more frequent head-shaking when dabbling are good indicators.\r\n	3298447935	2009-04-23 22:52:56
1806	In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. Similarly, Moyles (1989) found a negative correlation with increased in aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) on lekking sites and the number of displaying males present. Callipepla squamata pallida Brewster, 1881 (Northern Scaled Quail).\r\n	1145739150	2009-04-15 12:34:56
1807	Immature birds have white, feathered heads, and the pink of the plumage is paler. To dry their feathers after diving, darters move to a safe location and spread their wings.. Flocks numbering hundreds or thousands of these gulls can form when the feeding conditions are appropriate..\r\n	4455667067	2009-09-28 20:12:16
1808	It has been observed to join mixed-species feeding flocks going after schools of young Pacific Herrings (Clupea pallasii).  Mallard  is derived from the Old French malart or mallart  wild drake , although its ultimate derivation is unclear. As a result of escapes from wildfowl collections, they are now established in Great Britain, from where they have spread widely into Europe.\r\n	9654514037	2010-10-23 13:45:17
1809	Recent research shows it also preys on jellyfish in some areas. Egg-laying starts in April in more southerly colonies but seldom occurs before June in Greenland. The second explanation suggests that  the cost of trait expression may vary with environmental conditions,  so that a trait that is indicative of a particular quality may not work in another environment..\r\n	9529689565	2010-09-18 13:34:35
1810	The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic insects.\r\n	1299823327	2009-09-27 10:47:36
1811	Unlike ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. The Black-footed Albatross is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, because it is taken incidentally by longline fishing. Yellow Bitterns feed on insects, fish and amphibians..\r\n	3798775508	2010-11-19 19:14:48
1812	This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. The Ferruginous Hawk is one of the only two hawks that have feathers that cover their legs down to their toes, like the Golden Eagle. They reach sexual maturity at two years of age, and a maximum age of almost 18 years has been recorded in the wild..\r\n	9478615131	2009-05-25 22:50:14

1815	However, the overall foraging behavior of Andean Flamingo remains unclear and further studies are needed to determine this process.. Hybrid offspring of Hawaiian Ducks seem to be less well-adapted to native habitat, and utilizing them in reintroduction projects apparently reduces success. This maximizes their efficiency to meet their high metabolic needs during flight.\r\n	6894373701	2010-10-21 14:41:33
1816	There was no difference in concentration when comparing genders.. Some species, including Cattle Egret, Yellow-headed Caracara and Galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.. Unlike the paleoparabronchi, air traveling through the neopulmonic bronchi travels bidirectionally, compared to the unidirectional flow through the parabronchi.\r\n	9286550077	2009-11-15 20:11:49

1818	Respiratory air sacs often form air pockets within the semi-hollow bones of the bird s skeleton.. Unlike the chicks of other species, northern gannet chicks do not move about the nest or flap their wings to ask for food, this reduces the likelihood that they will fall from the nest.. Wingspan in both the largest cranes and the largest bustards can range up to 2.53 m (8.210 ft)..\r\n	5518618946	2009-08-26 12:39:51
1819	A pair was observed to breed on the Simmonds Islands in 1980, but this seems to have been an isolated incident.. Chicks then tend to lose weight before fledging, which happens after 141 days. The neck is buffish, the upperparts are grey, the belly and flight feathers are black, and there is a large white patch in the wings.\r\n	9735624082	2009-06-26 19:14:25
1820	The American Kestrel, whose populations have experienced considerable decrease, is one species in which the extensive predation by the recovered Cooper s hawk population is a major concern.. The nest is a shallow saucer of twigs and plant fibers, lined with leaves, in thick vegetation. The home ranges of separate coveys overlap only slightly or not at all.\r\n	7598664726	2010-04-15 18:18:47
1821	Predators of Trumpeter Swan eggs include Common Raven (Corvus corax), Common Raccoon (Procyon lotor), Wolverine (Gulo gulo), American Black Bear (Ursus americanus), Brown Bear (Ursus arctos), Coyote (Canis latrans), Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) and Northern River Otter (Lontra canadensis). The female builds a well-concealed nest on the ground below dense vegetation, especially Eragrostis variabilis bunchgrass. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form.\r\n	5018136180	2010-10-24 22:25:25
1822	Muscovy Ducks had been domesticated by various Native American cultures in the Americas when Columbus arrived. The legs, bill, and bare facial patch are dull yellow.. Woodpeckers use their chisel-like bills to excavate their cavity nests, a process which takes, on average, about two weeks.\r\n	4843870973	2010-11-15 12:46:13
1823	The superorder Neognathae comprises 27 orders that have a total of nearly 10,000 species. Considering mtDNA D-loop sequence data, they may have evolved in the general area of Siberia; Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. Another fairly accurate sign is that rump feathers with a single white dot indicate a female; rump feathers with more than one white dot indicate a male..\r\n	1801790219	2010-10-21 20:24:15
1824	The Harpy Eagle is an actively hunting carnivore and is an apex predator, meaning that adults are at the top of a food chain and have no natural predators. Some crepuscular petrels and prions are able to identify their own burrows within dense colonies by smell. Even with both physical and behavioral adaptations to make migration easier, this journey is filled with peril and there are many threats migrating birds face.\r\n	4192801617	2010-06-28 21:51:36
1825	However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch species winter in the North Temperate Zone, but in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. Although the Common Scoter is a winter visitor to the UK, there are some breeding pairs in the north of Scotland. In Britain, these birds occur in winter in good numbers principally along the east and south coasts, where they favour rocky shorelines adjacent to the sea.\r\n	3421528879	2010-04-25 11:57:39
1826	Airspeeds varied a great deal, but near the minimum metabolic rate rather large changes in airspeed did not require dramatic rises in energy consumption. They get most of their dietary energy from scavenging, with refuse, most provided directly by humans, locally comprising more than half of their diet. Like other species in the genus Mergus, it has a crest of longer head feathers, but these usually lie smoothly rounded behind the head, not normally forming an erect crest.\r\n	8588232477	2009-04-17 17:55:16
1827	Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. In other languages it is just a white-backed duck; for example in French, morillon  dos blanc, or Spanish, pato lomo blanco. The Least Bittern and much larger and different-looking American Bittern often occupy the same wetlands, but may have relatively little interaction because of differences in foraging habits, preferred prey, and timing of breeding cycles.\r\n	8380249377	2010-11-19 11:38:49
1828	It feeds on fish (often via kleptoparasitism), other birds, small mammals, eggs and carrion.. Also in North America, attempts to reintroduce endangered Whooping Cranes by mixing them with flocks of Sandhill Cranes have been largely unsuccessful in part due to natural predators picking off the unnaturally unwary birds. Pain and sensitivity can persist for weeks or months after the procedure, and neuromas can form along the cut edges.\r\n	8683304491	2009-10-11 21:40:45
1829	Due in part to the interbreeding of various migratory subspecies with the introduced non-migratory Giant subspecies, Canada Geese are frequently a year-around feature of such urban environments.. More common species, such as the European Honey Buzzard, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. The exact systematic placement of the King Vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.\r\n	2656650079	2010-03-18 15:50:50
1830	Adult female Harpys regularly grab large male howler or spider monkeys or mature sloths weighing 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb) in flight and fly off without landing, an enormous feat of strength. The most important wintering area is the Baltic Sea, where a total of about 4.5 million gather.. House Sparrows, European Starlings, and other small birds may nest in or near a Swainson s Hawk s nest..\r\n	8613673020	2010-05-21 21:49:35
1831	It has oval white wing-patches in flight. By contrast, the Whooper and Trumpeter Swans  names accurately describe their calls  a deep hooting and a higher-pitched French horn-like honk, respectively. Illegal poaching for meat however continues and declines have been noted in parts of India.\r\n	2530175893	2010-04-27 22:19:40
1832	Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather. The ecotourism industry has grown dramatically in the past few years, with revenues generated for. They eat fish, crustaceans, and molluscs.\r\n	5551203035	2009-06-13 22:26:45
1833	It also occurs on Hispaniola and some of the Venezuelan islands, and is a very rare vagrant to Trinidad, Curaao and the USA.. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified) which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.:70. The adult Sarus Crane is very large with grey wings and body; a bare red head and part of the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed bill.\r\n	0871561731	2010-08-26 18:32:51
1834	In some instances crested wheatgrass and smooth brome have forced out native vegetation, creating monoculture habitats. Like all cormorants, this includes stretching the gular sac with the hyoid bone and repeated  yawning ; as in many but not all cormorants, the Pelagic Cormorant s display furthermore includes arching the neck and hopping, lifting the folded wings and rapidly fluttering them to show the white thigh patches. It cannot be confused with any other duck in its range..\r\n	5981476141	2009-03-24 17:28:13
1835	It breeds in northern Canada and Alaska in a variety of tundra habitats. The colours result not from any green or blue pigments but from the micro-structure of the feathers and the resulting optical phenomena. Many Laysan chicks that nest within five meters of building structures exhibit a condition referred to as  droopwing  which commonly manifests itself in the chicks inability to raise their wings and which thus drag on the ground, resulting in broken bones and open sores.\r\n	2375081575	2010-07-10 19:33:44
1836	In flight, these birds soar with their wings in a dihedral.. Incubation lasts from 2123 days, usually performed by the female and rarely by the male. It can eat shallow-bodied fish as long as 18 cm (7 in) but its prey is commonly smaller fish, around 7 cm (3 in) long.\r\n	8341979102	2009-11-13 11:11:22
1837	The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. It grows larger than its closest relative, the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) and is intermediate in size between the two storks its co-exists with, the Jabiru and Wood Stork. The sexes are similar, although males tend to be slightly larger.\r\n	4298992144	2009-10-26 19:17:22
1838	Unlike some New World vultures, the King Vulture lacks eyelashes. Animal foods become more important during the summer breeding season and may be the primary food source at that time of year, especially while regurgitating to young. Innominate bones are evolutionary significant in that they allow birds to lay eggs.\r\n	1435450068	2009-04-24 15:15:15
1839	The nominate subspecies gularis has a range from West Africa to Gabon, with some birds breeding in southern Europe. Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal. It hunts insects such as dragonflies or dobsonflies while in flight, flapping little as it rides a wind current and stoops upon a fly, grabbing it with its foot and immediately transferring the prey to its bill.\r\n	4317646530	2009-02-13 11:32:57
1840	It has a mainly coastal distribution and occurs in two plumage forms, a slaty-gray plumage in which it can only be confused with the rather uncommon dark morph of the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and a white form which can look very similar to the Little Egret although the bill tends to be paler and larger. On dry land, darters walk with a high-stepped gait, wings often spread for balance, just like pelicans do. This is a medium-sized, compact hawk, 3641 cm long.\r\n	3545907540	2010-11-15 21:52:41
1841	The bird s plumage is dark above and white below. The Broad-billed Sandpiper is strongly migratory, spending the non-breeding season from easternmost Africa, through south and south-east Asia to Australasia. But as habitat was transformed through urbanization or agriculture, the doves apparently spread out into smaller, less long-lived colonies.\r\n	6241709392	2010-07-13 10:28:30
1842	Black wing patches visible in flight. Chicks are altricial, or helpless at birth. They roost in groups in low thorny trees..\r\n	2045645379	2010-02-18 16:38:47
1843	Bennett and the juvenile were sentenced to a $1 fine, probation, and court fees of about $500, a penalty which was denounced by various conservation organizations as being too light. The breeding season is from MarchApril (the borderline between the dry season and the wet season in the neotropics) onwards. The iris is bright red in the spring, but duller in the winter.\r\n	7579932314	2009-07-21 14:44:21
1844	They usually breed in colonies, occasionally mixed with cormorants or herons. The male s courtship display is a dive with folded wings, and a climb, sometimes completing a loop. The species also suffers from frequent, unexplained egg infertility..\r\n	6335992959	2010-12-11 11:15:40
1845	So are the two species of Paradigalla, which are polygamous. Smaller sized colonies are also found elsewhere in the British Isles, the Murmansk area of Russia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen, Labrador, Nova Scotia and Maine. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles.\r\n	9877531810	2009-11-14 20:36:46
1846	These are omnivores like most gulls, and they will scavenge as well as seeking suitable small prey.. In smaller streams, they are present in pairs or smaller groups, and they float down, twisting round and round in the rapids, or fishing vigorously in some deep pool near the foot of some waterfall or rapid. The breeding male is unmistakable.\r\n	3657536018	2010-05-20 13:44:39
1847	It has been noted that many albatross species dance upon reuniting with their partner every year; however, for Waved Albatross (P. In addition, some full-grown birds (especially in North America) have white  epaulettes  on the upper part of each scapular feather tract. The Great Frigatebird is a lightly built large seabird up to 105 cm long with predominantly black plumage.\r\n	4963495031	2010-05-17 14:24:19
1848	columbianus is the smallest of the Holarctic swans, at 115150 cm (4559 in) in length, 168211 cm (6683 in) in wingspan and a weight range of 3.49.6 kg (7.521.2 lb). Standing up to 1.53 m (5.0 ft), with a wingspan of up to 2.3 m (7.5 ft) and a weight up to 5 kg (11 lb) is the AfricanGoliath Heron (Ardea goliath), the largest of the diverse and well-known herons and egrets. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Trumpeter Swan was hunted heavily, both as game and a source of feathers.\r\n	7894260168	2009-06-11 10:14:37
1849	At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. One species, the Common Poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next.\r\n	2932149734	2010-05-12 23:56:38
1850	Therefore, sodium and water is reabsorbed into the plasma by renal tubules. Aquatic plants and fish eggs can often become locally important food items as well.. It will also sting if the predator is close enough to get the vomit in its face or eyes. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related Striated Heron as among the world s most intelligent birds.\r\n	9370983999	2009-04-15 12:35:17
1913	They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. The length of the tunnel varies depending on the substrate and the species; Sand Martins make relatively short tunnels ranging from 5090 cm (2035 in), for example, while those of the Burrowing Parakeet can extend for more than three meters (nearly 10 ft).\r\n	9312130437	2010-04-19 22:41:28
1851	hudsonius (Linnaeus, 1766) breeds in North America and is sometimes considered a distinct species, C. The fledging stage is reached at 25 to 34 days of age, though the offspring will return to the nest to be fed until they become independent around 8 weeks. Magnificent Frigatebirds are currently classified as Least Concern (LC)  by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but the Proceedings of the Royal Society paper recommends that, because of the genetic uniqueness of those on the Galpagos, this status be revisited.. Long distance migrants are believed to disperse as young birds and form attachments to potential breeding sites and to favourite wintering sites.\r\n	9331310241	2010-08-28 20:27:37
1852	The Magnificent Frigatebird is silent in flight, but makes various rattling sounds at its nest.. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. Longline fishing is responsible for other deaths. Due to their close relationship and phenotypic similarities, as well as the recent decline in wild Common quail populations throughout Europe, the Japanese quail is often crossed with the Common quail in order to create hybrids that are used to restock the declining wild quail populations.\r\n	7946282131	2009-12-26 10:36:31
1853	The word anhinga comes from the Brazilian Tupi language and means devil bird or snake bird.. Incubation lasts about 25 days by both the male and the female(two days longer than that of most American quails). Length ranges from 47 to 56 cm (19 to 22 in), body mass from 652 to 1,020 g (1.437 to 2.249 lb) and wingspan ranges from 76 to 94 cm (30 to 37 in). As a consequence, these areas are concentrated with toxic compounds due to mineral and hydrocarbon exploration; this exploitation has increased in the last two decades.\r\n	4718279590	2010-03-20 16:41:27
1854	There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young Puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan s photo-illustrated children s book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). Golden Eagles occupy the mountains and coastal areas of California and Baja California in Mexico where hot, dry summers and moist winters are typical. Close up, the bare skin of the Great Egret s gape line extends in a dagger shape behind the eye, while the Intermediate s is less pointed and ends below the eye. The sexes are similar, but young birds have black vermiculations and ochre specks on the body plumage..\r\n	5311209051	2009-05-27 15:36:29
1855	The eggs measure approximately 47 mm  36 mm (1.9 in  1.4 in). This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. The egg is large compared to the size of the bird, averaging 61 millimetres (2.4 in) long by 42 millimetres (1.7 in) wide and weighing about 62 grams (2.2 oz). In some cases these birds alternate between two or three nesting sites in a region from one year to another.\r\n	7732704633	2009-09-16 22:31:33
1856	It ranges from light to dark olive-green in color with a whitish throat and belly, flanks barred black, and undertail cinnamon. Thus it may be that the Terek Sandpiper under natural conditions may mate with Common Sandpiper (A. vicinior occurs in the highlands of Chiapas State, Mexico, Guatemala, and western Honduras.. Midway Atoll, Laysan Island, and the French Frigate Shoals have more than 90% of the breeding pairs at 551,940.\r\n	8844896559	2009-02-26 11:11:58
1857	olor), introduced to North America, is scarcely smaller. The flight call of the latter is a low and soft ringing bark, bow-wow...; the Whistling Swan gives a markedly high-pitched trisyllabic bark like wow-wow-wow in flight. Both snow and blue phases have rose-red feet and legs, and pink bills with black tomia ( cutting edges ), giving them a black  grin patch.  The colors are not as bright on the feet, legs, and bill of immature birds. In some areas where they are common, crayfish can be important prey for this species.\r\n	2008142157	2010-11-17 13:43:36
1858	Experiments show that what may at first appear to be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic parent-offspring conflict.. In Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis), female-female pairs are often associated with supernormal clutches (clutches of 4-6 eggs; a normal clutch for Larus gull species is 2-3 eggs) and these clutches are usually infertile. This species was first described by Linnaeus in 1758 under its current scientific name. Some earlier authors included the darters in the Phalacrocoracidae as subfamily Anhinginae, but this is nowadays generally considered overlumping.\r\n	2907958875	2010-08-25 16:11:39
1859	The Stilt Sandpiper breeds in the open arctic tundra of North America. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months. Like many ground-nesting species, adults perform a broken-wing display to lure presumed threats away from their nest and young.. Although this bird coexists well at the edges of urban areas, it is declining in some areas as human populations increase.\r\n	1501909333	2010-11-19 22:28:33
1860	It is mainly resident, but some northern birds migrate short distances. The Crested Eagle is almost always observed singly or in pairs. Johnsgard (2002) observed weather delayed lekking of up to two weeks by sharp-tailed grouse in North Dakota. Alternatively, the genus may be disassembled altogether and in the most extreme case be reduced to the Great, White-breasted and Japanese Cormorants..\r\n	5525498428	2009-06-13 22:54:33
1861	Several chases involving the Golden chasing Verreaux s were witnessed but only one where a Verreaux s chased off the Golden. The grebes are declining in New England. Storm petrels also use dynamic soaring and slope soaring to travel over the ocean surface. percautus occurs in southeastern Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula), Belize, and Petn department in Guatemala..\r\n	4692667973	2009-03-12 22:17:14
1862	The species name cristatus refers to the crest.. Classified as  least concern  on the IUCN Red List criteria, the global conservation concerns are relatively low because of the large numbers that breed in Scandinavia and the Arctic. This species prefers to walk on the ground or along tree limbs rather than fly. Home ranges in most of the range can vary from 20 to 200 km2 (7.7 to 77.2 sq mi).\r\n	4304964051	2010-05-23 11:13:57
1863	The male has a long pointed tail (10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in)) and a dark grey bill crossed by a pink band. This species is largely silent away from the nest. In areas where farmers are tolerant, nests in flooded rice fields and those in wetlands have similar rates of survival. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host s young, which allows them to destroy the host s eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host s chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks..\r\n	5070669329	2010-06-21 14:29:38
1864	As the name implies, these are noisy birds with a clear three-note whistling call.. Creation of National Parks has decreased the egg collecting; however, environmental education will be necessary to completely eliminate this activity.. The adult dark morph has black-brown upperparts and underparts, apart from the tail and flight feathers, which are grey barred with dark as in the light morph but possibly with darker grey. It is likely that Exopterygota is paraphyletic in regard to Endopterygota.\r\n	6946354027	2010-07-10 13:15:13
1942	Because it lacks a syrinx, the Black Vulture, like other New World Vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. The weight of adult birds is typically 713.6 kg (1530 lb), with an average weight in males of 11.9 kg (26 lb) and 9.4 kg (21 lb) in females.\r\n	9171338142	2009-05-25 21:21:53
1865	An alternate account by Maximilianus Transylvanus used the term Mamuco Diata, a variant of Manucodiata, which was used as a synonym for Birds of Paradise up to the 19th century.. Lesser Scaup drakes in nuptial plumage are often said to be recognizable by the purple instead of green sheen of the head and a darker back. The cause of death was suffocation or drowning in mud as a direct result of the Canada Goose s pecking the head of the Brant into the mud. However, this barrier has some higher altitude zones lying in the eastern Taklamakan.\r\n	5760286577	2009-05-12 23:29:28
1866	Those wintering in the Indian Subcontinent make the taxing journey over the Himalayas, often taking a break in wetlands just south of the Himalaya before continuing further south to warmer regions. The birds leave winter quarters to breed starting in mid-February. Red-necked Grebes attempt to evade birds of prey by diving; when feeding, dives average less than 30 seconds, although escape dives are more prolonged.. Individuals usually forage while standing in water but will also feed in fields or drop from the air, or a perch, into water.\r\n	5634490893	2010-04-21 22:43:34
1867	At one time, Cooper s Hawks were heavily hunted in persecution for preying on poultry and were called  chicken hawks . The 4060% of eggs that are fertile result in birds raised only for their meat or for production of foie gras: they grow fast like mallard-derived breeds but to a large size like Muscovy Ducks. The Jack Snipe is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. A single, white egg is laid during late November or early December.\r\n	2479738716	2009-03-23 14:32:11
1868	While nesting, the female will turn to face the sun throughout the day, so the nest is surrounded by excretion.. In the Scottish Highlands, a White-tailed Eagle was found dead with talon piercings in its skull likely from a female Golden Eagle it had been interacting with the previous day. Networks were processed fi rst by the median-joining method (Bandelt et al., 1999 ). Globally, the Little Egret is not listed as a threatened species..\r\n	3403419277	2010-01-27 22:55:26
1869	The largest populations in North America are in Florida and California.. The female is brown above with white upper tail coverts, hence females, and the similar juveniles, are often called  ringtails . The wild female is similar in plumage, but is also much smaller, and she has feathered face and lacks the prominent knob. As the name implies, these are noisy birds with a clear whistling waa-chooo call..\r\n	8214800889	2009-09-15 16:50:24
1870	These stiff and elongated feathers are raised into a fan and quivered in a display during courtship. The consensus view in contemporary paleontology is that the birds, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Historically, they range as far south as Texas and southern California. The first section of the alimentary canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum.\r\n	0946344717	2010-11-19 21:31:57
1871	It is a wader which breeds on cultivated land and other short vegetation habitats. Although the nostrils on the Albatross are on the sides of the bill. Annual bag figures in the late 1970s were about 188,000 birds in the USA and about 360,000 in Canada. The Willet (Tringa semipalmata) has been observed trailing American White Ibis and catching prey disturbed by them, and even kleptoparasitizing (stealing) from them, in J.\r\n	5408982177	2009-12-20 10:38:22
1872	The Crested Eagle may avoid direct competition with the Harpy Eagle by taking generally smaller prey. One of the most interesting things about this bird is the melanistic  black  phase  this species occurs in two colour morphs, with no intermediates. High-level Flight  birds will hunt while soaring, but the success rate is generally low.. This association of the Golden Eagle with Rome has also led to the adoption of similar symbols in other countries; for instance, the adoption of the related and physically similar Bald Eagle as the national bird of the United States was inspired by the conception of the United States as a modern reincarnation of the Roman Republic, a theme that recurs in other elements as well (including the prevalence of neoclassical architecture in American public buildings and the use of Roman terminologysuch as naming the upper house of Congress the Senateto hark back to the Roman model).\r\n	8149946977	2009-03-19 17:29:30
1873	bahamensis - Lesser Bahama Pintail - in the Caribbean, and a vagrant to southern Florida. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. Returning the eggs to the nest will avoid re-laying as the female would if the clutch were removed.. The egg is incubated for around 50 days.\r\n	9560190445	2010-09-25 19:53:20
1874	However, a language has, in addition to words, grammar (that is, structures and rules). They have been introduced to Nevada in the United States of America and Hawaii, along with several other species of francolin.. It also has an elaborate courtship display and a variety of loud mating calls. In addition, they contained less yolk androgens.\r\n	9421431605	2009-03-18 16:21:49
1875	It is migratory, wintering mainly in the Aleutian Islands.. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured that the Corn Crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.. They nest in a sheltered location on the ground near water, usually among thick vegetation such as sedges and bulrushes, sometimes in small loose groups and not rarely next to colonies of gulls or terns; several females may deposit eggs in a single nest. In most mound-building species, males do most or all of the nest construction and maintenance.\r\n	4148133470	2010-02-12 11:26:35
1876	In Accipiter hawks (the most species-rich acciptrid genus), prey is mainly comprised by other birds. Unlike the enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebirds, waders, and swimming and diving species. The chicks are nidifugous and follow the mother around after hatching. The egg-laying period varies with latitude, weather, and possibly food supply.\r\n	1113032194	2009-10-17 19:23:51
1877	It was initially described by Georges Cuvier in 1829 as Ibis molucca. The North American population winters in Mexico, the southern United States, Central America, and the West Indies, and the Old World birds winter in tropical Africa and southern Asia.. This is a shy and wary species, which will normally make its escape on foot, but if startled it will explode into a short fast flight into cover. When disturbed, they usually escape by running and rarely take to flight..\r\n	4359446833	2009-03-12 23:11:38
1878	Birds gain altitude by soaring in circles on a rising thermal and then set their wings and close their tails as they glide, slowly losing altitude until they find another thermal and rise with it. Alternatively, the Common Teal might be derived from the GWT, with the molecular difference being due to genetic drift or a founder effect in the latter and possibly Speckled Teal introgression in the former. The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions. in autumn then moving back north to western Yukon and Alaska in spring.\r\n	7061513299	2009-07-20 15:27:45
1879	They nest mainly on the Tibetan Plateau. The nestlings hatch in approximate 3 to 5 day intervals. The stiff flight, like a large Manx Shearwater, is also distinctive. It has no objection to human-altered habitats such as pastures and roadsides, and it often perches on fenceposts..\r\n	4100612754	2010-03-23 11:52:35
1880	In most countries where Greater Scaup are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal hunting licences that are required to pursue other game. The largest species on average is the Yellow-billed Loon (Gavia adamsii) of the Arctic, at up to 1 m (3.3 ft) and 7 kg (15.4 lb). Once they reach the top of a ridge of the hill, they fly off to adjacent hill, alighting some distance down, and again picking their way upwards. olor), introduced to North America, is scarcely smaller.\r\n	8638306788	2010-11-23 16:45:29
1881	The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the Black Oystercatcher, although this name is also used locally for the Blackish Oystercatcher and the African Oystercatcher. Since it is one of only two whistling-duck species native to North America, it is occasionally just known as the  whistling duck  in the southern USA.. The  cape  can be raised in display..\r\n	8788476099	2009-10-24 21:31:51
1882	Summer adults have grey backs and breast, dark belly and white undertail. The size of the Mallard varies clinally, and birds from Greenland, although larger than birds further south, have smaller bills and are stockier. Their breeding habitat is grassland adjacent to shallow marshes and steppe lakes.. Size readily distinguishes this species from most other raptors when it is seen well.\r\n	3567968504	2009-10-20 12:33:22
1883	In New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have been declared threatened. The initial flight often includes a short flight on unsteady wings followed by an uncontrolled landing. The young are capable of flight at 5565 days of age.. Males and females fish differently, which may contribute to why Blue-foots, unlike other boobies, raise more than one young.\r\n	2039286793	2009-03-18 16:41:49
1884	Juveniles will remain at sea in the West Pacific for 34 years until they are ready to breed  survival rate is 46% during this time vs 90% for birds over 3 years old (Bell et al. Small bird species in more than 20 passerine families, and a few non-passerinesincluding most hummingbirds, kinglets and crests in the genus Regulus, some tyrant flycatchers and several New World warblersuse considerable amounts of spider silk in the construction of their nests. The long-lived known captive Golden Eagle, a specimen in Europe, survived to 46 years of age. This bird is named for the scaly appearance of its breast and back feathers.\r\n	3387609638	2010-03-26 21:43:27
1885	Both adults have a white ear-patch.. When either of them spots a threat, they give a warning sound to let their partner know that danger is approaching. Incubation takes about 11 weeks and both parents are involved. The Black-bellied Whistling Duck is a mid-sized waterfowl species.\r\n	5520498310	2010-11-26 19:20:37
1886	As in other synthliboramphine murrelet species (e.g. Birds in the NCA are most frequently sighted in mid March, May, and June, in the early morning and evening when they are actively hunting. Many of the same predators sometimes compete over territory and food with this species. At least five more sightings have since been confirmed in England..\r\n	4058741774	2009-10-27 21:43:48
1887	The chick fledges at seven or eight weeks. It is found in Colombia and Panama. These species, which include the albatrosses, petrels, diving petrels, storm petrels, fulmars and shearwaters, are widely known as  tubenoses . Birds communicate alarm through vocalizations and movements that are specific to the threat, and bird alarms can be understood by other animal species, including other birds, in order to identify and protect against the specific threat.\r\n	2638727422	2009-10-23 22:37:37
1888	The power requirements of each bird at each speed could be calculated, and that information was used to establish that the birds were generally compromising between maximizing their range and minimizing their metabolic rates with more emphasis on the former. To build below the Grass  Root;. In the second week of life they are covered in white down. It is currently absent in the Eastern United States as breeding species east of a line from North Dakota down through westernmost Nebraska and Oklahoma to West Texas.\r\n	5248622385	2009-05-20 12:45:26
1889	The call is a typical sandpiper  peep , and the display song a harsh trill.. Most displays by mature Golden Eagles (67% for males and 76% for females) occur, rather than around the nest, at the edge of their home ranges. When one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest, males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship; during changeovers, the birds may also  yawn  at each other.. According to National Geographic, when migrating these birds can fly at altitudes of 8 km (nearly 27,000 ft); Tundra Swan flocks usually fly in V formation..\r\n	2974505820	2009-03-21 21:55:59
1890	Sometimes the cob will use his wings to run faster and appear larger in order to scare away a predator.. Slightly larger mammals, such as rabbits and tree squirrels, are also occasionally predated. When the females arrive a few weeks later, the male performs courtship displays such as aerial manoeuvres, strutting and tail-fanning. Hunting is normally in cover, but, particularly in the wintering areas, it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads.\r\n	0645613192	2009-07-26 15:43:41
1891	and the northern parts of Europe. The keel of the sternum serves as an attachment site for the muscles used for flight, or similarly for swimming in penguins. Here, homosexual behavior refers to same-sex pair-formation and chick-rearing, not to same-sex copulation, for which there are very few documented examples. Pliny likened the old-world bittern s call to the roaring of a bull,  boatum tauri , whence the generic name Botaurus..\r\n	2188771744	2009-02-20 13:38:50
1892	The often footless and wingless condition of the skins led to the belief that the birds never landed but were kept permanently aloft by their plumes. Birds are one of the only major taxa where monogamy is the dominant mating system. All populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea, usually in estuaries and bays, but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands. It is found only in south Florida and some parts of the Caribbean.\r\n	3952137188	2010-09-23 16:15:35
1893	The Bible also notes migrations, as in the Book of Job (39:26), where the inquiry is made:  Doth the hawk fly by Thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south?  The author of Jeremiah (8:7) wrote:  The stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed time; and the turtledove, and the crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their coming. . Additionally affecting the Red-shouldered Hawk was the greater availability of firearms in the early 1900s, leading to unchecked hunting of this and all other raptor species until conservation laws took effect in the latter half of the 20th century. The latter species is an Old World vulture in the family Accipitridae (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers), whereas the American species is a New World vulture. Though the taxonomic distinctness of the Komandorski and Kuril Islands populations, which used to winter in Japan, is controversial, it is without doubt that they disappeared around 1929..\r\n	9412017822	2009-06-17 20:53:54
1914	Bird-hit aviation records from the United States show most collisions occur below 600 m (2000 ft) and almost none above 1800 m (6000 ft).. A related phenomenon called  abmigration  involves birds from one region joining similar birds from a different breeding region in the common winter grounds and then migrating back along with the new population.\r\n	0246841719	2009-12-14 14:14:28
1894	It is considered a vulnerable species because of its restricted breeding range.. In theory, each and every Aythya species is able to produce potentially fertile hybrids with any other, though due to their different ranges and behavioral cues given during courtship most of these hybrids are only known from birds kept in captivity without conspecific mates.. The Southern Royal Albatross (Diomedea epomophora) lags behind the Wandering only slightly in all aspects of size. Unmated males perch in trees and wait for opportunities to mate..\r\n	2468363220	2010-09-27 21:29:52
1895	Unlike ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. They were once thought to be adverse to cities and towns, but are now fairly common urban and suburban birds. The karyotype of the Muscovy Duck is 2n=80, consisting of three pairs of macrochromosomes, 36 pairs of microchromosomes, and a pair of sex chromosomes. There also existed a Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene species known from Ibiza, Puffinus nestori, which may have been the direct ancestor of the Mediterranean Shearwater (Heidrich et al.\r\n	1081395988	2009-07-21 16:28:52
1896	This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish. When alarmed, it tends to run rather than fly, but when a group take to the wing, the individuals fly off in different directions which may confuse a potential predator. In winter plumage identification is difficult, although it is shorter legged and longer winged than the Little Stint. Age seems to play a role on the size of eggs produced as older females tend to lay larger eggs than their younger counterparts..\r\n	8883792081	2010-05-26 11:55:24
1897	As the young gull ages, the gray-brown coloration gradually fades to more contrasting plumage and the bill darkens to black before growing paler. Less well-known than the woodpeckers and toucans, the barbets can range up to 273 g (9.6 oz) and 33 cm (13 in) in the Great Barbet (Megalaima virens).. Some Canada Geese have taken up permanent residence as far south as Florida, in places such as retention ponds in apartment complexes. The American Wigeon is a medium-sized bird; it is larger than a teal, but smaller than a pintail.\r\n	5193697591	2009-04-22 21:47:19
1898	Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. initiative partner Dennis Mercer.. The tarsus is fairly short for the size of the bird at 3.3 cm (1.3 in).. In the mornings the birds fly downhill to drink water.\r\n	5347165594	2009-08-26 12:50:42
1899	The females will fly over the colony a number of times before landing. In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and wintering ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year. However, Golden Eagles were reportedly the most prolific predator of neonatal calves from the Porcupine caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd of central Alaska. The Mute Swan is found naturally mainly in temperate areas of Europe across western Asia, as far east as the Russian Maritimes, near Sidemi..\r\n	0743373739	2010-04-18 19:17:46
1900	The common feral pigeon was the second most prevalent prey species in Sierra Espua Regional Park in Spain, making up 18.8% of a sampling of 99 from 5 nests. maxima, or the  Giant Canada Goose , and the smallest (with the separation of the Cackling Goose group) is B.\r\n	5897691012	2009-08-28 17:30:17
1901	The Indian population is less than 10,000, but of the three subspecies, is the healthiest in terms of numbers. For example, the pink-footed goose migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the Dark-Eyed Junco migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American Goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon.\r\n	4730470294	2009-01-23 15:24:42
1902	It was originally native to parts of Southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa and humid tropical and subtropical Asia. Naturally, these gulls are attracted to the surface activity of large marine animals, from Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) to Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), to capture fish driven to the surface by such creatures..\r\n	1651419689	2009-05-17 13:49:30
1903	In the southern reaches of the species breeding range, i.e. The nest is constructed within shallow water by piling up rushes, straw, grasses with their roots and mud so that the platform rises above the level of the water to form a little island.\r\n	0519474704	2010-05-19 15:48:29
1904	Most of the population is migratory, wintering further south, but some birds in the milder westernmost areas of Europe are resident. The Atlantic Puffin has a direct flight, typically 10 metres (33 ft) above the sea surface and higher over the water than most other auks.\r\n	0045351330	2010-07-16 11:27:26
1905	Vocal is probably preferred over display, because the denseness of their habitat could prevent displays from being seen from a distance. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch.\r\n	9792781104	2010-10-11 21:22:29
1906	The American White Ibis is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. diversities (for example, mean # is 0.0106 in Phasianus colchicus ; Qu et al., 2009 ).\r\n	6907199907	2009-07-27 18:13:45
1907	Moreover, all seabirds have obligate biparental care, so it would be evolutionarily costly for the male to spend months of effort raising a chick that is not his genetic offspring.. In September 2009, an adult female, after being kept captive for twelve years in a private reservation, was fitted with a radiotransmitter before being restored to the wild in the vicinity of the Pau Brasil National Park (formerly Monte Pascoal NP), in the State of Bahia..\r\n	7133199099	2009-06-11 18:57:47

1910	At about 4 years old, pre-breeding birds will fly back to the colony to find a mate  this may take 1-2 seasons (Bell et al. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base.\r\n	6823436302	2010-11-16 11:41:36
1911	Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water s surface while holding steady above the water. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements.\r\n	9141816763	2010-06-13 17:42:18
1912	Blue-footed Boobies display behavior that is described in the Flexible Investment Hypothesis, which states that a female will adjust the allocation of resources to maximize her lifetime reproductive success. The double-toothed kite generally hunts from a perch above the rainforest floor.\r\n	8973595925	2010-08-20 15:54:19

1916	Extensively cleared farmland is marginal habitat that cannot maintain self-sustaining populations for long. Brown-morph birds have tails of the same color and pattern, but the rest of the plumage is much more brown, giving the appearance of a more uniform bird with less light plumage below and a conspicuously grey tail.\r\n	0331931896	2010-12-23 14:14:27
1917	They suggest that the species is better split into the Grey-lined Hawk, Buteo nitidus and the Grey Hawk Buteo plagiatus), but the American Ornithologist Union does not recognize the Grey Hawk as two different species. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.\r\n	2055658898	2009-04-10 12:58:58

1927	It has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). Females do a majority of, but not all, of the incubating and largely attain their own food up to the stage of egg-laying, after which they are typically fed by the male.\r\n	7269489288	2009-08-22 11:56:15
1928	The Eastern Spot-billed Duck is darker and browner; its body plumage is more similar to the Pacific Black Duck. Dry grassland, tidal mudflats and the seashore are less frequently used.\r\n	7064245278	2010-11-24 22:43:32
1929	The head, neck and underparts are white; the relatively short bill is yellow with a dark ring; the back and wings are silver gray; and the legs are yellow. Young may continue to return to the colony for another 10 to 15 days to roost or to try to get food from their parents.\r\n	1047857163	2010-09-10 21:52:29

1937	The plumage varies with age, with the juveniles starting chocolate brown. There are several genera, of which the most widespread is Podiceps with nine species, one recently extinct.\r\n	3654959971	2009-08-18 22:45:32
1938	Moderately sized species, including larger Anas ducks such as Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese such as Bean Goose (Anser fabalis) are perhaps most often recorded. Ducklings are precocious and feed on their own day two after hatching, but are guarded, brooded, and led to foraging sites by the hen for approximately 40 to 60 days..\r\n	8780621836	2010-05-18 14:19:30
1939	It has pointed wings and plumage that varies by season. For the first few days the chick may be fed with these beak-to-beak but later the fish are simply dropped on the floor of the nest beside the chick which swallows them whole.\r\n	3505349928	2009-03-16 12:23:42
1940	In the end of the 19th century it began expanding its range into southern Africa, first breeding in the Cape Province in 1908. Typical hunting grounds are sheltered inlets and bays; especially outside the breeding season they can also be seen fishing out at sea.\r\n	6830061726	2009-04-13 12:20:17
1941	Unlike the widely known flightless Palaeognathae, Ratites such as Ostriches and Emus, Tinamous can fly, although in general they are not strong fliers. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Velvet Scoter, and some taxonomists still regard it as so.\r\n	8384550106	2010-07-19 20:29:42
1943	It can be differentiated from these species by its greyish legs with pink joints (tibio-tarsal articulation), and also by the larger amount of black on the bill (more than half). There have been no extensive reports on longevity and mortality in the species..\r\n	8941689503	2009-08-28 16:17:51

1946	The word anhinga comes from the Brazilian Tupi language and means devil bird or snake bird.. The head is dark brown with a bald, black face, and the thick downcurved bill is dusky yellow.\r\n	5069015277	2010-10-16 12:13:18
1947	In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. For example, the Thick-billed Parrot is another bird that nests and roosts communally; individuals of neighboring roosts has been observed to communicate with each other each morning to signal their readiness to form flocks for foraging.\r\n	1753046113	2010-07-21 10:46:48

1949	In the Alps, it is believed to be advantageous for eagles to nest below the meadows that host their Alpine Marmot prey so they can fly downhill, a much easier flying method while carrying a heavy load than flying uphill.. These birds shared morphological traits with both species.\r\n	0958707912	2009-08-20 20:42:45
1950	On the island of Lundy the number of Puffins decreased from 3,500 pairs in 1939 to 10 pairs in 2000. This species nests alone, unlike most herons, which nest in colonies. Mississippi Kites usually lay two white eggs (rarely one or three) in twig nests that rest in a variety of deciduous trees.\r\n	3577528986	2010-07-23 10:47:26

1952	Scotland, being surrounded by coasts and possessing quite a wet climate, often hosts water birds which become prey such as colonies of petrels (largely Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis)), making up to 17% of the recorded prey in 26 nests with a 119 sample size in the Outer Hebrides), migrating throngs of sandpipers and plovers (up to 5.9% and 2.8% in 25 nest in the northern Inner Hebrides) and gulls (making up a whopping 23% of prey recorded in 25 nests in the West-Central Highlands). This is a social bird, often seen in family groups of 6-12. The Short-tailed Hawk hunts from soaring flight, often at the borders between wooded and open areas.\r\n	9383868157	2010-09-27 12:40:21
1953	Peacocks are polygamous, and the breeding season is spread out but appears to be dependent on the rains. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be develop being also influenced by ovariole design. A large clutch could indicates brood parasitism by other Greater Scaups or even ducks of other species.\r\n	6118299279	2010-02-23 11:33:49
1954	Voles, gophers, mice, moles and chipmunks may locally be favored based on abundance. Both hypotheses seem rather spurious initially, with the GWT and Common Teal s male nuptial plumage being unique and very complex, and the tendency to gain, not lose, strong sexual dimorphism overwhelming in the dabbling ducks. The male peacock is predominantly blue with a fan-like crest of spatula-tipped wire-like feathers and is best known for the long train made up of elongated upper-tail covert feathers which bear colourful eyespots.\r\n	6511682607	2010-02-14 20:21:16

1956	In most other species of grouse, only the female takes care of the young, but the male Willow Ptarmigan also helps with feeding the brood and protecting them. Within science, the greylag goose is most notable as being the bird with which the ethologist Konrad Lorenz first did his major studying into the behavioural phenomenon of imprinting.. A strong wind at a bird s back can help it fly much faster, while flying directly into a wind can slow the bird down considerably..\r\n	4194966506	2009-01-15 17:59:27
1957	It is highly gregarious, but does not follow ships. Wallmo  observed winter coveys 3 and 7 miles (1.8 and 11.2 km) from water in Big Bend National Park in southwestern Texas.. A chick takes its first flight at about 6070 days old, and is fed by the adults until about 90 days, when it leaves the land, possibly with the adults, to live over the open seas..\r\n	9802678480	2010-08-14 23:35:41
1958	They have a variety of methods for decreasing the likelihood of this happening. It was also discovered that younger broods (those less than six weeks old) had three times the rate of pecking than older broods. Occasionally smaller raptors, especially large falcons, will drive eagles to the ground.\r\n	3751421510	2010-11-10 12:45:55
1959	Notable features of Great Blue Herons include slaty flight feathers, red-brown thighs, and a paired red-brown and black stripe up the flanks; the neck is rusty-gray, with black and white streaking down the front; the head is paler, with a nearly white face, and a pair of black plumes running from just above the eye to the back of the head. A typical brood contains 5 to 15 ducklings. Common Pheasants are bred to be hunted and are shot in great numbers in Europe, especially the UK, where they are shot on the traditional formal  driven shoot  principles, whereby paying guns have birds driven over them by beaters, and on smaller  rough shoots .\r\n	3705064459	2010-07-14 12:41:12
1960	After viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) killed off many rabbits in Spain, the average breeding success of Golden Eagles in Northern Spain dropped from 0.77 in 1982-1989 to 0.38 by 1990-1992. It is an uncommon to fairly common winter visitor to all parts of South Asia, and Southeast Asia from Myanmar through to Indochina and southern China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.. The Chinese Egret averages 68 cm in height.\r\n	1275322540	2009-11-21 20:45:40
1961	Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), American Black Bears (Ursus americanus) and Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are known to take larger nestlings or fledglings and, in the latter predator, many eggs. The frequency of feedings decreases as the offspring near fledging. Nest success for 96 Sarus nests that were protected by locals during 20092011 via a payment-for-conservation program was 87%..\r\n	1995803049	2009-03-27 21:11:33

1964	Some ducks, such as the Garganey, move completely or partially into the tropics. They cannot dive, and feed exclusively on the surface. In all albatross species, both parents incubate the egg in stints that last between one day and three weeks.\r\n	5706421690	2010-02-20 10:21:17
1965	Ruffed Grouse have two distinct morphs, grey and brown. The downy juvenile birds leave the nest soon after hatching. The genus name Podiceps comes from Latin podicis,  vent  or  anus , and pes,  foot , and is a reference to the placement of a grebe s legs towards the rear of its body.\r\n	9234149807	2009-07-12 21:24:40
1966	The color variation between populations is less pronounced than between birds of the same population. Heat loss is minimized while wading in cold water, while heat gain is minimized in the hot temperatures during rest and flight.. For Bayesian analyses, four simultaneous Monte.\r\n	5216616113	2010-05-15 21:15:36
1967	Many species attack predators or apparent predators near their nests. Incubation and fledging periods are not known.. Juvenile birds have the appearance of the female with a shorter tail until young males begin to grow characteristic bright feathers on the breast, head and back at about 10 weeks after hatching..\r\n	8537944355	2009-05-22 12:18:54
1968	The Great Egret has a noticeable kink near the middle of its neck, and the top of its longer bill nearly aligns with the flat top of its head. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. He is 2932 cm (11.412.6 in) long with a 5460 cm (21.2523.6 in) wingspan, and weighs about 180 g (6.4 oz).\r\n	2807671427	2010-09-26 21:52:33

1970	Many authors have used a definition similar to  all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus.  Avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade (that is, one based on physical characteristics). On clear mornings (and occasionally in late afternoons), the Tiny Hawk will sometimes sun itself on a high open branch. Full-grown swans can weigh well over 10 kg (22 lb) and are probably the largest birds habitually hunted by Golden Eagles.\r\n	3946308842	2009-12-20 17:56:30
1971	The Osprey breeds near freshwater lakes and rivers, and sometimes on coastal brackish waters. When their eggs and young are threatened, the parents can be quite aggressive, initially displaying with head bobbing and hissing. Traffic noise was found to decrease reproductive success in the Great Tit (Parsus major) due to the overlap in acoustic frequency.\r\n	3607638005	2009-06-17 15:26:51
1972	Lekking habitat can be managed by burning, mowing, clear cutting, and grazing across the entire range of the sharp-tailed grouse subspecies. The species can stand up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) and have a wingspan of 2.3 meters (7.5 feet). The juveniles are brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes..\r\n	0099581090	2010-05-26 16:54:50
1973	Predation can be heightened during migration: the Eleonora s Falcon, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. This genetically distinct population is now estimated at about 20 breeding pairs or 6080 total individuals at most. Reed Warbler raising a Common Cuckoo, a brood parasite..\r\n	8816453121	2009-03-21 22:52:24

This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name.. Some of its brown feathers have molted and have been replaced with white feathers..\r\n	6852307508	2010-03-27 16:28:20
1975	Although it has adapted to human settlement in many areas, nest disturbance, continuing changes in land use, and collision with utility lines are still potential problems. It is difficult to distinguish from other all-dark Oceanodroma species, and the first English record had to be DNA-tested to eliminate the possibility that it was a Leach s Storm Petrel, since populations of north-eastern Pacific Leach s Storm Petrels contain individuals that show completely dark rumps.. In addition to the implications for song learning, the mirror neuron system could also play a role in territorial behaviors such as song-type matching and countersinging..\r\n	0277459070	2010-10-15 21:42:48
1976	Outside the breeding season, this bird is normally found on inland waters, rather than open coasts.. It is also used to represent Cozcacuauhtli, the thirteenth day of the month in the Mayan calendar (13 Reed). Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat.\r\n	4343465715	2009-04-27 19:14:25
1977	The Willow Ptarmigan can be distinguished from the closely related Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) by its larger size and thicker bill and by the fact that it is not generally found above the tree line while the Rock Ptarmigan prefers more elevated, barren habitat. The frequency of calling reduces after a few weeks, but may intensify again near the end of the laying period before falling away towards the end of the breeding season. The Corn Crake is sympatric with the African Crake on the wintering grounds, but can be distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern.\r\n	0361377058	2009-04-17 14:35:11

1980	They may walk slowly, at around or less than 60 paces a minute, snatching prey when it is observed. Alternate colloquial names include  Bin Chicken ,  Dump Chook  or  Tip Turkey , from its habit of rummaging in garbage, and  Sheep-bird . These four groups account for the majority of described species.\r\n	9601646369	2010-10-27 10:46:58
1981	It has a slow flight, with its neck retracted. The female is light brown, with plumage much like a female Mallard. It was found that the chick sleeps much of the time between its parents  visits and also involves itself in bouts of exercise.\r\n	4846471623	2009-05-27 18:29:52
1983	The best opportunity to see a Black Rail is during an extremely high tide when the birds are forced out of the coastal marshes into nearby fields and brush for cover. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. It differs in appearance from the similar Greater Yellow-headed Vulture in several ways.\r\n	7842340281	2010-03-23 14:12:45
1984	The largest species of this diverse order is the Toco Toucan (Ramphastos toco) of the neotropic forest. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other Cattle Egrets. Some species, including the ground-nesting puffbirds, prefer flat or gently sloping land, digging their entrance tunnels into the ground at an angle.\r\n	4765130400	2010-10-21 11:42:33
1985	Most ground-nesting species have well-developed distraction displays, which are used to draw (or drive) potential predators from the area around the nest. However, the Cackling Goose is usually considerably smaller, scarcely larger than a Mallard with a much shorter neck and smaller bill.. The subclass Neornithes has two extant superorders .\r\n	2593058895	2010-07-17 17:22:48
1986	These pathways are often related to important stopover locations that provide food supplies critical to the birds  survival. It is found also in the Pacific coast of California, Mexico, Central America, Peru and Chile. Disappointment Island has 72,000 pairs, Auckland Island has 3,000 pairs, Adams Island (Auckland Islands) has 100 pairs, and Bollons Island (Antipodes Islands) has 100 pairs..\r\n	8935846071	2009-03-14 21:36:53
1987	On the conservation front, the Golden Eagle is itself unintentionally contributing to the conservation crisis of another animal, the Island Fox, a small insular relative of the Gray Fox found only in the Channel Islands of California. Young herons are not as successful at fish capture as adults, as strike rates are similar but capture rates about half that of adults during the first 2 months post-fledging.. But Linnaeus refers also to older sources, and therein much information on the origin of the common name is found..\r\n	4804074712	2010-02-10 19:11:14
1988	The invader often responds by rolling over and presenting talons to the aggressor. The Cooper s Hawk, as a natural predator of almost any North American bird smaller than itself, can inadvertently deplete populations of rarer, conservation-dependent species. Lizards turn up with some regularity as prey in some of the hotter, drier portions of the Golden Eagles range.\r\n	8769151861	2010-09-13 20:34:56
1989	The species exhibits sexual dimorphism; the female is larger than the adult male and has a white throat and breast, and the male s scapular feathers have a purple-green sheen. Gunnison Grouse are notable for their elaborate courtship rituals. By 1987, population increases were being noted, and the Alberta population alone was estimated at 1,800 pairs.\r\n	3760442486	2009-02-23 21:22:23
1990	Its sensitivity to changing climate as well as to water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the Ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. These birds forage on rocky coasts, picking up food by sight. Adult swimming at the Henry Doorly Zoo.\r\n	3439124571	2009-09-26 13:16:23
1991	By the third summer, the upper-wing coverts are largely replaced by dark brown feathers, however not all feathers moult at once giving many juvenile birds a grizzled pattern. An oil spill occurring in winter, when the Puffins are far out at sea, may affect them less than inshore birds as the crude oil slicks soon get broken up and dispersed by the churning of the waves. They are generally distributed more to the south than the other North American Accipiters, the Sharp-shinned Hawk and the Northern Goshawk.\r\n	1608395036	2010-06-18 23:35:56
1992	The partridge s face and throat have rich fulvous and rufous tints. Generally herons lay between three to seven eggs. Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the very similar Collared Pratincole, which also has a chestnut underwing, and Black-winged Pratincole which shares the black upperwing flight feathers and lack of a white trailing edge to the wing.\r\n	6648919599	2010-01-16 19:22:43
1993	Per one anecdote from the Himalayas, a Golden Eagle reportedly tried to predaceously attack a Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia) and was killed by the much larger felid, although this could have actually been a case of an overly bold eagle trying to displace a large predator from its own home range. This lapwing is a very rare vagrant in western and northern Europe, where this gregarious bird is usually found with Northern Lapwings. They are mainly woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch.\r\n	0338233351	2010-05-12 10:43:22
1994	Though they still have a large distribution, they are currently classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN. The species is venerated in India and legend has it that the poet Valmiki cursed a hunter for killing a Sarus Crane and was then inspired to write the epic Ramayana. It still has protection, but is now allowed to be killed or held in captivity at the discretion of the Minister of Conservation..\r\n	1862793212	2010-04-20 17:38:24
1995	The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American White Ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.. This involves walking through its marshy habitat until a bird is disturbed and flies up. There are about 30 subspecies in five (sometimes six) groups.\r\n	3229045657	2010-08-10 17:53:51
1996	Breeding areas include south-central Alberta, central Saskatchewan, southwestern Manitoba, and west and southern Minnesota. The Atlantic Puffin and other pelagic birds are excellent bioindicators of the environment as they occupy a high trophic level. The Trumpeter Swan has a large, wedge-shaped black bill that can, in some cases, be minimally lined with salmon-pink coloration around the mouth.\r\n	6833311398	2009-06-11 18:59:17
1997	Upon birth, the chicks have gray plumage; they don t gain adult coloration for two-three years. Similar species: Gray Francolin has grey-brown and buff body, buff instead of black throat, and lacks rufous collar.. The population of these birds has declined due to the introduction of rats onto some islands used for nesting..\r\n	6540169424	2010-07-15 10:38:12
1998	This species is smaller than the Common Eider. This combined with relatively low hunting pressure, make it far less vulnerable than larger members of the family, notably curassows.. Herons and storks are also quite different in structure from the crane..\r\n	1467761101	2010-06-11 18:42:51
1999	Not only are the flamingos offspring numbers diminished by mining activities, but they are also affected by the egg collection by locals. The strong bill is flesh-coloured, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Paleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites; also, in Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen.\r\n	6063245601	2010-03-16 21:42:25
2108	The wing drying action is seen even in the flightless cormorant but commonly in the Antarctic shags and red-legged cormorants.\r\n	6509851958	2009-08-12 19:28:34
2000	They suggest that the species is better split into the Grey-lined Hawk, Buteo nitidus and the Grey Hawk Buteo plagiatus), but the American Ornithologist Union does not recognize the Grey Hawk as two different species. The neck is able to retract and extend, and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds.\r\n	7186022291	2009-03-26 14:12:22
2001	The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. The male is all black, except for white patches on the nape and forehead.\r\n	4539439880	2009-01-28 10:19:27
2002	The flamingo uses a flushout pattern of ventilation where deeper breaths are essentially mixed in with shallow panting to flush out carbon dioxide and avoid alkalosis. It is typically 3338 cm (1315 in) long and weighs 190-280g (6.7-10 oz).\r\n	9261886692	2010-10-21 23:49:48
2003	In the nominate subspecies, males average 3.2 kg (7.1 lb) and females average 2.84 kg (6.3 lb). As such, it is still not recognized as kosher in the [United] States today, but in Israel, no such ban ever existed. .\r\n	5098723632	2010-09-16 22:23:53
2004	John Clare, the nineteenth-century English poet based in Northamptonshire, wrote  The Landrail , a semi-comic piece which is primarily about the difficulty of seeing Corn Crakes  as opposed to hearing them. Other nest linings, like the lichen in this American Golden-Plover scrape, may provide some level of insulation for the eggs, or may help to camouflage them.\r\n	8324445540	2009-09-12 16:34:25
2005	Large concentrations of Ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The nest consists of a shallow depression made by the female and lined with her down.\r\n	7353442817	2009-07-28 17:15:41
2006	A chick will glide from the nest down to the sea after 75 days, which will mark the point at which it separates permanently from its parents. Despite its reasonably copious strength of numbers, the Providence Petrel is deemed to be in a precarious disposition because its breeding is confined to two mountain tops and one tiny islet, and is therefore at great risk from a catastrophe..\r\n	6487463019	2010-04-28 15:43:38
2007	At 78100 cm (3139 in) in length and 3.14.8 kg (6.810.6 lb) in weight, this is a very large cracid. The tarsus is fairly short for the size of the bird at 3.3 cm (1.3 in)..\r\n	8201678962	2009-10-17 10:46:51

2017	This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. But its darker legs and feet and the crisper wing pattern (visible in flight) tend to give it away, and of course they are only rarely found in the same location..\r\n	4858277995	2009-02-12 23:43:12
2018	Despite this, falconers occasionally use them to hunt wolves. The Masked Duck (Nomonyx dominicus) is a tiny stiff-tailed duck ranging through the tropical Americas.\r\n	2211356747	2010-05-22 13:36:14
2019	Large specimens of this toucan can weigh to 870 g (1.9 lb) and 0.65 m (2.1 ft), at which size the magnificent beak alone could measure about 20 cm (7.9 in).. The female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a  Queen Eider ) is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure.\r\n	5174158740	2010-07-13 21:22:15
2020	The control of migration, its timing and response are genetically controlled and appear to be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The Kalij Pheasant (Lophura leucomelanos) is a pheasant found in forests and thickets, especially in the Himalayan foothills, from the Himalayas of Nepal to western Thailand.\r\n	8817363691	2010-06-26 16:13:58
2021	His argument relied on a radical shift in perspective from that of Linnaeus: rather than defining species in ideal terms (and searching for an ideal representative and rejecting deviations), Darwin considered variation among individuals to be natural. A hunting Swainson s Hawk will use several strategies.\r\n	9913129482	2009-08-19 21:55:33
2022	Physically, Snowy Plovers are shorter-legged, paler and greyer above than its Old World sister species, and breeding males lack a rufous cap.

(b.) trizonatus, is another form sometimes upgraded to a full species, though most recent authorities have placed it as a subspecies of another species, the Mountain Buzzard, B. However, it seems that it prefers higher elevations.. In the Middle East there are populations in Turkey, Iraq and Iran, while in Central Asia the range extends eastwards as far as north-west China, Mongolia and the Lake Baikal region of Siberia..\r\n	9498793111	2010-07-23 16:56:14
2156	It breeds in southern Europe, North Africa and across Asia. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. They eat aquatic plants with some molluscs, aquatic insects and small fish. There are also various dark morphs where the plumage is sooty-gray or just blackish in some cases.\r\n	0421502422	2009-11-14 11:26:25
2157	At Mount Lorette in Alberta, approximately 4,000 Golden Eagles may pass during the fall, the largest recorded migration of Golden Eagles on earth. The true wild Muscovy Duck, from which all domesticated Muscovys originated, is blackish, with large white wing patches. Buteos or kites) and a 5% or less rate of loss in eagles and vultures. DeGraaf and others  reported that in winter, Scaled Quail are usually found within 1.25 miles (2 km) of a source of water..\r\n	0709557090	2010-06-21 13:38:36
2158	They may allow an approach as close as 1 metre before flying (taking off with a  loud, popping wing noise ) and on rare occasions have been caught by hand.. The Collared Plover (Charadrius collaris) is a small shorebird in the plover family, Charadriidae. Similar fossil finds in the southern hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya. Others, including some shorebirds, cast shade with their bodies as they stand over their eggs.\r\n	8106580258	2009-10-18 17:51:45
2159	It is sometimes included with the latter in the genus Oxyura, but apparently the Masked Ducks of our time are the descendants of a missing link in the Oxyurinae evolution, having changed but little for millions of years.. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Grey Hawks feed mainly on lizards and snakes, but will also take small mammals, birds and frogs. This dabbling duck is strongly migratory and winters further south than its breeding range (so far so that there have been four reports in Australia).\r\n	1025372195	2010-11-11 16:32:28
2160	It has a booming call which involves inflation of the red gular sac. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they do not need to be as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.. The originally Older Scots  Cornecrake  was popularised by Thomas Bewick, who used this term in his 1797 A History of British Birds. It has an occurrence range of 140,000 km2 (54,000 sq mi)..\r\n	8766510228	2009-10-18 10:40:14
2161	This is a somewhat aggressive duck; males often fight over food, territory or mates. However, it lacks a white axillary spur, and juveniles show a distinctive diamond-shaped belly patch.. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.

2162	prevent avian depredation would include habitat. Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the Black Oystercatcher, although this name is also used locally for the Blackish Oystercatcher and the African Oystercatcher. Some studies have found that the duration and direction of flights made while foraging for food are similar for both sexes. Females do not appear to favour specific males.\r\n	4484130973	2010-12-17 19:42:52
2163	The Banded Quail (Philortyx fasciatus) is a species of bird in the family Odontophoridae. As a result of these unique characteristics, it has been given its own taxonomic genus, Pandion and family, Pandionidae. European breeders winter in Africa. The southern hemisphere constellation Apus represents a bird-of-paradise..\r\n	9255616674	2009-07-19 18:31:54
2164	It is resident all-year in most of its range, but the southernmost population migrates north in winter and the Caribbean birds disperse widely outside the breeding season.. Altogether, the bird is most similar to another enigmatic bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the Kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus). The plumage of the Crested Eagle is somewhat variable. The male raised-wing display seems to be a synapomorphy of the Sulae; like almost all cormorants and shags but unlike almost all gannets and boobies, darters keep their wrists bent as they lift the wings in display, but their alternating wing-waving, which they also show before take-off, is unique.\r\n	6576899072	2009-07-14 16:38:56
2165	Unlike the Australian Kestrel, the Black-winged Kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. In its natural habitat the Common Pheasant lives in grassland near water with small copses of trees. The breast and back are mottled in black, chestnut, and cream colours, with black spots on the flanks and above. The feathers over a ptarmigan s nostrils help to warm the air it inhales, while those over a woodpecker s nares help to keep wood particles from clogging its nasal passages..\r\n	3552584152	2009-04-20 19:45:49
2166	The females and young migrate to lower altitudes and may overwinter 100 miles (160 km) from their breeding grounds in wooded valleys and hilly country. This raptor is often considered sluggish and retiring, preferring to perch inside leafy canopy when not flying.. The young is duller with smaller horn, and has brown tail and wings.. This bird has a number of calls, including a harsh kuk kuk kuk, usually heard at night..\r\n	9651416386	2009-03-21 11:11:58
2167	Wilson s Plovers forage for food on beaches, usually by sight, moving slowly across the beach. Other developmental and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism.:143 In haplodiploidy, which is a type of sex-determination system, the offspring s sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed it could be a part of courtship behaviour.. There are two theories regarding to the evolution of male ornamental plumage, i.e.\r\n	8856441654	2009-06-25 19:38:15
2168	The Thicket Tinamou can be found in pairs, families or as a solitary bird and like most Tinamous it prefers to walk than fly.. Europe s second was found at Dawlish Warren, Devon, England on 7 November 2006; initially identified as a Little Auk, its true identity came to light when photographs were posted to the BirdForum.net website. The drake has a low breathy call, and the hen a quiet trilling coo.. The weight of nominate race individuals is 6.87.8 kg (16 lb), while five adult sharpii averaged 8.4 kg (18.5 lb).\r\n	5622756348	2010-07-28 16:28:16
2169	They have been used in this practice at least since the Middle Ages. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish Plovers, will restore experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.. Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous Period.\r\n	4666408870	2009-10-27 13:23:37
2170	The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth. Animal foods become more important during the summer breeding season and may be the primary food source at that time of year, especially while regurgitating to young. Occasionally tackling larger vertebrate prey such as water snakes (Xenochrophis piscator), Sarus Cranes may in rare cases feed on the eggs of birds and turtles. The changing of habitats has led to a general population increase of the Red-tailed Hawk, an occasional predator of its cousin.\r\n	5730607511	2010-09-12 10:21:58
2171	The tail of the Golden Eagle is longer on average than those of Haliaeetus eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight as opposed to the other eagles where the head is often more than twice the length of the tail. There is some sexual dimorphism in size, as the slightly heavier male weighs 1.72.5 kg (3.7-5.5 lb) compared to the 1.41.9 kg (3.14.2 lb) female. In most seabird colonies several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. The Emperor Penguin is one of the heaviest living birds as well as the largest penguin..\r\n	0342203622	2009-06-25 16:24:42
2172	Of these birds 24,000 pair breed on Midway Atoll and 21,000 pair breed on Laysan Island. The fights are preceded by threatening gestures, which are also seen outside the breeding season. The Atlantic Puffin is the only species in the genus Fratercula to occur in the Atlantic Ocean. It has become locally extinct on a number of islands, including Wake Island.\r\n	1250845103	2009-02-11 14:54:49
2173	In Labrador the Puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, they were able to adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.. Humans regard certain insects as pests, and attempt to control them using insecticides and a host of other techniques. It has been observed that both Golden Eagles and Lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. The migration of geese is an example of the annual, large-scale movement of birds between their breeding (summer) homes and their nonbreeding (winter) grounds..\r\n	3836965331	2009-04-26 17:57:23
2174	The Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus) is a goose which breeds in Central Asia in colonies of thousands near mountain lakes and winters in South Asia, as far south as peninsular India. This duck belongs to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae..  In Guatemala, at Volcn San Pedro the estimates are 10.5 individuals/km2 (Rivas Romero and Cbar Carranza 2008) and for Sierra de las Minas the estimates are 1.6 individuals/km2 (Quionez 2010).. The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath.\r\n	6930747286	2009-07-15 22:15:43
2175	Hunting success is apparently relatively low. Once contact is made, rabbits and hares will often kick or try to bite the eagle but escape is unlikely once they are pinned to the ground. However, as a homeothermic endotherm it is still faced with the challenge of maintaining a constant body temperature while being exposed to both the day (light period) and night (dark period) temperatures of its environments. Sonograms can also be roughly converted back into sound..\r\n	3974069089	2009-10-19 18:15:49
2176	Finally, conservationists hope to improve the management and coordination of already existing nature reserves where the Falcated Duck is present. Blue-winged Teal are sexually mature after their first winter. In 2011, captive bred cranes were reintroduced into Thailand. At least 12 bobcats have been trapped and relocated in an attempt to save the cranes.\r\n	3207634503	2009-06-17 12:28:23

They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. As the Colombian Andes were uplifted around 6 mya, this species  ancestors were cut off from the population to their southeast.\r\n	4917886268	2010-07-13 12:28:48
2178	Tiny Hawks occasionally soar above the forest canopy.. It has the typically  shearing  flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. Below are more detailed description of habitats occupied by Golden Eagles in both continents where they occur.. Manx Shearwaters are long-lived birds.\r\n	1777351185	2010-04-19 22:20:25
2179	Nevertheless, the chicks face many dangers which range from attacks by foxes or birds of prey, getting separated from the rest of the brood, bad weather and coccidiosis. The prey brought to the nest by males averaged 1.5 kg (3.3 lb), while the prey brought to the nest by females averaged 3.2 kg (7.1 lb).. Male parents of first clutches may father chicks in later male s clutchs, probably due to sperm storage within female reproductive tracts, which is common in birds. The difference between them is slight and generally agrees with Bergmann s Rule:.\r\n	1771260785	2010-09-14 19:19:18
2180	Both sexes have a bare red face and greyish legs (the latter separating it from the red-legged Silver Pheasant). He noted that the external differences between Chinese geese and breeds descended from the Greylag Goose belied a rather close relationship:. Evolutionary and ecological factors. The muscles that depress the lower mandible are usually weak except in a few birds such as the starlings and the extinct Huia which have well developed digastric muscles that aid in foraging by prying or gaping actions.\r\n	2548690110	2009-09-22 22:58:26
2181	A short tail and long, narrow wings with four long, finger-like feathers, and a shorter fifth, give it a very distinctive appearance.. The plumage is pinker than the slightly larger Greater Flamingo, but less so than Caribbean Flamingo. Local outbreaks of locusts may also be exploited for food by one or more age-classes of birds. The adult plumage is mostly blackish.\r\n	3205829329	2010-07-22 21:57:50

If basic criteria of the recovery plan are met, the Laysan Duck could be down-listed from endangered to threatened by 2019.. In 10 studies in Europe, corvids made up more than 5% of the prey remains, usually represented by Carrion Crows/Hooded Crows (Corvus corone/cornix), Rooks (Corvus frugilegus), Alpine Chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), Ravens or Eurasian Magpies (Pica pica).\r\n	6952517558	2009-04-12 13:37:40
2183	The afforement-mentioned  terror bird , Brontornis burmeisteri, has traditionally been classified as a member of this order, although this may not be an accurate classification.. The birds-of-paradise are members of the family Paradisaeidae of the order Passeriformes. The call is a plaintive peea-ay, similar to a cat s meow.. In the Arctic, the window of opportunity for nesting, incubating eggs, and raising a brood to flight state is open briefly, for about three months.\r\n	4670288011	2009-06-27 18:33:47
2184	Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.. The Ruff forages in wet grassland and soft mud, probing or searching by sight for edible items. The leading edge of the inner wing is black. Males incubate for about 10.5 hours of each day while females usually incubate for the remainder of each day and the night, with eggs left without incubation for about 6 minutes of each hour.\r\n	9515673892	2009-11-24 17:35:48
2185	Like all frigatebirds the male has a large red sac on the front of the throat which is inflated during courtship. Traffic noise was found to decrease reproductive success in the Great Tit (Parsus major) due to the overlap in acoustic frequency. It can stay down for significant periods.. Eskimo Curlews picked up food by sight, as well as feeding by probing.\r\n	8475363766	2010-03-18 22:57:55
2186	They mainly eat insects, crustaceans and fish. Even with both physical and behavioral adaptations to make migration easier, this journey is filled with peril and there are many threats migrating birds face. The species name, atratus, means  clothed in black,  from the Latin ater  black . The English word  peacock  has come to be used to describe a man who is very proud or gives a lot of attention to his clothing..\r\n	2264875032	2010-04-17 14:15:42

Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non breeding season. Aquila chrysaetos daphanea Severtzov, 1888  known variously as the Asian Golden Eagle, Himalayan Golden Eagle or Berikut. Though some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species..\r\n	0968564331	2009-10-16 15:12:13
2188	Loss and degradation of stopover habitat not only can result in more birds dying while on migration, but it can also have serious repercussions in terms of nesting success. Far more speciesincluding parrots, tits, bluebirds, most hornbills, some kingfishers, some owls, some ducks and some flycatchersuse natural cavities, or those abandoned by species able to excavate them; they also sometimes usurp cavity nests from their excavating owners.

Forrest Lee would head the centers Canada Goose production and restoration program. During the breeding season, the Ruffs diet consists almost exclusively of the adults and larva of terrestrial and aquatic insects such as beetles and flies.\r\n	8657810047	2010-11-20 18:41:20
2192	Buller s Shearwater can also be found to breed in cracked-up rock on treeless stacks or cliffs however, and most of the other colonies  on the smaller Poor Knights islands between the main islands and off the southeast of Aorangi[verification needed]  are of such a nature. An attempted capture of a Great Blue Heron by a Golden Eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. During winter, the plumage of both sexes becomes completely white, except for some black feathers in the tail. The eye looks almost triangular in shape because of a small, peaked area of horny blue-grey skin above it and a rectangular patch below.\r\n	5427125695	2010-09-23 18:40:42

2196	Whether a variation is adaptive or non-adaptive depends on the environment: different environments favor different traits. The terms  shitepoke  or  shikepoke  can be used as insults in a number of situations. Still others suggests that the outer plumage absorbs water but does not permit it to penetrate the layer of air next to the skin. For a long time, it was thought that the dark phase of the present bird was a distinct species Buteo fuliginosus.\r\n	1028279648	2009-06-24 16:39:10

Four pale green eggs are laid between March and May.. They dive from the surface, though many species make a characteristic half-jump as they dive, presumably to give themselves a more streamlined entry into the water.\r\n	2193681691	2010-02-19 15:37:17
2198	SOS Puffin is a conservation project at the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the Puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Notwithstanding, all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the darters and Sulidae (gannets and boobies), and perhaps the pelicans and/or even penguins, than to all other living birds.. The feathers on the lower neck are long and plume-like; it also has plumes on the lower back at the start of the breeding season. Song learning in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile listening to the father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template.\r\n	5807208487	2009-06-14 21:21:35
2199	Waterfowl are typically hunted using the contour flight with short glide attack technique, in order to surprise the prey before it can take flight or dive. The species is divided into two subspecies on the basis of size and geography. The Montezuma Quail eats insects, especially in summer, as well as plants. They are rare breeders in northern Scotland, particularly in Orkney, and no more than five pairs have bred there in recent years.\r\n	8539972567	2009-02-26 12:24:32

The Western Marsh-harrier is 43 to 54 cm in length, and has a wingspan of 115 to 130 cm and a weight of 400 to 650 g in males and 500 to 800 g in females. assistance to ranchers in targeted areas with.\r\n	8596881657	2010-09-25 16:49:23
2284	The juvenile Golden Eagle is similar to the adult but tends to be darker, appearing black on the back especially in East Asia. Vocalizations among jacanas usually occur between mating pairs or between fathers and their young. Eggs are incubated by the female for 21 to 23 days.\r\n	2403388608	2010-04-26 11:43:13
2357	They eat insects, crustaceans and worms.. Some pairs have been recorded staying together for many years.\r\n	4457717104	2009-06-25 22:59:58
2285	There are no breeding records  yet  from Colombia. The larger subspecies (but see below).. Predators of darters are mainly large carnivorous birds, including passerines like the Australian Raven (Corvus coronoides) and House Crow (Corvus splendens), and birds of prey such as marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus complex) or Pallas s Fish Eagle (Haliaeetus leucoryphus).\r\n	5893676806	2010-12-24 10:36:45
2286	The bill is dark with a long, sharp point. Migratory populations are longer-winged than those resident year round, but this cannot be used to delimit subspecies as it is quite obviously is a consequence of differing habits and can be expected to undergo convergent evolution in unrelated populations of this species that just share the same habits. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but will also take an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest.\r\n	2697915143	2009-03-21 13:29:57
2287	In India the breeding season is during the monsoon rains from April to August and end of May in the former breeding colony at Chilaw in Sri Lanka. The bill is thin and black and the legs dark red. The term colony has also been applied, perhaps misleadingly, to smaller nesting groups, such as forest-dwelling species that nest socially in a suitable stand of trees.\r\n	6381422257	2010-11-16 20:17:36
2288	Tree nests are known to be used exclusively in Estonia and Belarus. How long turkey vultures can live in captivity is not well known. The frigatebirds have the highest ratio of wing area to body mass and the lowest wing loading of any bird.\r\n	8614027051	2009-04-12 15:29:49
2289	Male Muscovy Ducks have spiralled penises which can become erect to 20 cm in one third of a second. Peafowl roost in groups during the night on tall trees but may sometimes make use of rocks, buildings or pylons. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs.\r\n	1349783505	2009-02-11 17:12:30

Dark morph schistacea (Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary) showing extent of yellow on the feet. In some populations, the males also show distinct moult migration, leaving the breeding areas as soon as the young hatch to spend the summer (June to September) elsewhere.\r\n	0830824166	2010-09-20 22:50:34
2291	In research conducted from 1995-97 in south-west Arizona, it was found that gray hawks produced an average of 1.32 young per nest between all three years when the study was being conducted (8). The genus name Botaurus was given by English naturalist James Francis Stephens and is the Latin for bittern, and also bull, because the bittern s call resembles the bellowing of a bull. The clutch is six to eight eggs but larger clutches have been noted..\r\n	3380015367	2010-08-16 21:56:55
2292	The Eurasian Wigeon is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some taller vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which it does very readily. The final possibility is that Numenius is a Latinized form of the Greek noumenios, which was the word Diogenes Laertius used to refer to a species of curlew. They are somewhat larger than the related Common Redshank.\r\n	9921464321	2010-08-15 17:31:42
2293	Studies show that only females (adults and immatures) hunt in this fashion, and only a few individuals account for most of the kills.. Heterodactyly is like zygodactyly, except that digits 3 and 4 point forward and digits 1 and 2 point back. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive.\r\n	7552614601	2010-06-11 11:38:36
2294	Incubation averages 30 days, and nest success is high (79% in one study) compared to ground-nesting species like the Teal. Green-winged Teal appear to prefer the small seeds of nutgrasses (Cyperus spp.), millets (Panicum spp.), and sedges to larger seeds, but they also consume corn, wheat, barley, and buttonbush (Cephalanthus spp.) seeds. In Europe it has been known as simply  White-fronted Goose ; in North America it is known as the Greater White-fronted Goose (or  Greater Whitefront ), and this name is also increasingly adopted internationally.\r\n	8024607460	2009-08-18 16:52:44
2295	The Tufted Puffin was first described in 1769 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas. In another experiment, Blue-footed Booby chicks that were placed in Masked Booby nests were more likely to engage in siblicide, which reveals that parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beaks..\r\n	2345547712	2009-06-14 11:45:33
2296	Of the riflebirds in the genus Ptiloris, two are endemic to the coastal forests of eastern Australia, one occurs in both Australia and New Guinea, and one is only found in New Guinea. Despite its reasonably copious strength of numbers, the Providence Petrel is deemed to be in a precarious disposition because its breeding is confined to two mountain tops and one tiny islet, and is therefore at great risk from a catastrophe.. The breeding season starts in October and lasts for almost half a year.\r\n	3626740298	2010-03-24 12:11:42
2297	The ducklings are taken by their mother in her bill to rivers or lakes immediately after hatching, where they feed on freshwater invertebrates and small fish fry, fledging when 6070 days old. It is commonly found in lowland moist forest in subtropical and tropical regions up to 1,800 m (5,900 ft) altitude. In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) normally form at least 90% of the food fed to chicks.\r\n	4026588928	2010-02-12 11:18:18
2298	This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is finished. The specific incubation behavior of this species is unknown. The Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), also known as Baird s Cormorant, is a small member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae.\r\n	7648353856	2010-12-28 22:29:58
2299	In Ireland, it died out as a breeding species in the 18th century, but a flock of about 30 appeared in County Cork in November 2011, and a smaller flock a year later. It is found in Costa Rica and Panama. The bird was present until 14 November, with an estimated 1000+ birders travelled from as far afield as Edinburgh and (reportedly) Holland to see it , ..\r\n	5971165509	2010-02-17 23:13:15
2300	However, in the case of the American White Ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. The female looks similar to a female Green-winged Teal but with a longer tail, and a distinctive white spot at the base of the bill and a white throat that angles to the back of the eye.\r\n	2385718994	2010-08-12 18:28:47
2301	The male is monogamous, staying in the vicinity of the nest often seen perched on some elevated rock and keeping a watch against intruders. Males, 19-20  (some 50 cm) long, are bigger than females, (16-17  or about 45 cm).\r\n	4037460641	2009-02-16 20:38:51
2302	Primarily non-migratory, Masked Ducks are reported as very uncommon vagrants in the southernmost United States, along the Mexican border and in Florida.. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest.\r\n	2590931966	2010-11-27 12:24:38

2305	Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. The breeding habitat is a variety of wetlands including marshes, lakes, and damp heather moors..\r\n	5255886812	2009-09-24 16:47:50
2306	Several megapode species construct enormous mound nests made of soil, branches, sticks, twigs and leaves, and lay their eggs within the rotting mass. The three Elanus species have comparable plumage patterns and sizes, however, they are now regarded as distinct, and the name Black-winged Kite is used for E.\r\n	2344178324	2010-07-19 11:45:27

2311	But his anas indica (based, like Gessner s brief discussion, ultimately on the reports of Christopher Columbus s travels) also seems to have included another species, perhaps a whistling-duck (Dendrocygna). Some pairs nest year round, but the primary breeding season is from December to May during which pairs are often engaged in spectacular nuptial flights.\r\n	2154671763	2009-05-17 21:46:53
2312	The etymology of the word Gadwall is not known but the term has been recorded in usage from 1666.. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind.\r\n	5347783281	2010-09-28 11:17:43
2313	A massive benefit to cliff nests is that they tend to be largely or entirely inaccessible to mammalian predators on foot (including humans). They have fairly dull plumage, dark brown above and paler below.\r\n	2987320197	2010-06-27 12:50:59
2314	When they pair off with mating partners, often one or several drakes end up left out. Measuring 125 to 170 cm (49 to 67 in) in length, this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange bill bordered with black.\r\n	8204762771	2009-09-26 17:29:11
2315	In Tibet, Golden Eagles inhabit high ridges and passes in the Lhasa River watershed, where it regularly joins groups of soaring Himalayan Vultures (Gyps himalayensis). The species local name is  chir-ras-qua  after its noisy call.\r\n	1788449447	2010-10-10 19:32:38

2319	A recent proposed revision by Harold Hanson suggests splitting Canada and Cackling Goose into six species and 200 subspecies. It also occurs throughout the Caribbean, on both coasts of Mexico (from Baja California southwards) and Central America, and as far south as Columbia and Venezuela.\r\n	2320417584	2009-04-19 19:55:14
2320	The Sociable Weaver of southern Africa constructs massive, multi-family dwellings of twigs and dry grasses, with many entrances leading to different nesting chambers, accommodating as many as a hundred nesting pairs. 6 (40%) of 15 nestling losses in nests in Central Europe were from cainism.\r\n	1855122503	2009-12-18 17:45:15
2321	The Corn Crake is larger than its closest relative, the African Crake, which shares its wintering range; that species is also darker-plumaged, and has a plainer face.. Furthermore, a small resident population is known from Brazil, it being named as a new subspecies, brasiliensis, in 2008.\r\n	4447189940	2009-12-24 15:35:59
2322	In silhouette, the wigeon can be distinguished from other dabblers by its round head, short neck, and small bill. They often nest in colonies, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs.\r\n	5892709345	2009-09-11 21:37:32
2323	The latter species is an Old World vulture in the family Accipitridae (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers), whereas the American species is a New World vulture. Greater Scaup eat aquatic mollusks, plants, and insects, which they obtain by diving underwater.\r\n	3732308022	2010-06-11 18:39:25

Thanks to the conservation efforts of Anne LaBastille, in 1966 a refuge was established where this species was able to rebound.\r\n	9685897247	2010-09-26 10:59:46
2325	Up to five females have been known to mate with one male in a season. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased..\r\n	8726315124	2009-05-12 12:18:21
2326	Canada Geese have been implicated in a number of bird strikes by aircraft. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting.\r\n	8777315650	2009-10-17 17:57:10
2327	Breeding continues south through the eastern parts of Washington and Oregon, locally to the central valley of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and most of Texas. For example, in many amphibians, most notably in New Zealand s Leiopelma frogs, the genome consists of  core  chromosomes that are mostly invariable and accessory chromosomes, of which exist a number of possible combinations.\r\n	1261493215	2010-12-16 17:33:50
2328	The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. In a similar research venture in Panama, where a couple of captive-bred subadults was released, 52% of the male s captures and 54% of the female s were of two sloth species (Bradypus variegatus and Choloepus hoffmanni).\r\n	3887079560	2009-02-19 12:51:12
2329	This species can be found breeding in coastal areas from the extreme northwest portion of Russia, through much of coastal Scandinavia, on the Baltic Sea coasts, to the coasts of northwestern France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Mice are occasionally predated in upland areas far from the species typical aquatic environment.\r\n	6563280891	2009-03-23 22:37:28
2330	Late autumn storms may carry them south of their normal wintering areas, or into the North Sea. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks  wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully fledged and are ready to fly in five weeks.\r\n	2222368850	2010-03-13 13:23:11

2336	Nearly seven different call variants have been identified in the peacocks apart from six alarm calls that are commonly produced by both sexes.. Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction.\r\n	1513420139	2009-10-28 15:57:57
2337	Widespread and common throughout its range, the Scaled Quail is evaluated as Least Concern. It will often make its presence known, however, with its distinctive ki-ki-krr call or an aggressive, presumably territorial, growl.\r\n	2168867844	2009-05-26 11:27:56
2338	The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath. Triangle Island, for example, the largest seabird colony in British Columbia, Canada, is home to auks, gulls, cormorants, shorebirds, and other birds, as well as some marine mammals.\r\n	9706722337	2010-07-15 12:44:27
2339	The eastern birds, apart from being larger, tend towards less yellow on the bill, perhaps indicating that gene flow across Beringia, while marginal, never entirely ceased. The Grey Hawk (Buteo plagiatus) is a smallish raptor found in open country and forest edges.\r\n	3005252178	2010-06-12 12:53:14

2341	The longer and more complicated phalli tend to occur in waterfowl whose females have unusual anatomical features of the vagina (such as dead end sacs and clockwise coils). It is sometimes claimed that the word comes from a Celtic word for  limpet , but the sense-history seems to go in the opposite direction..\r\n	0903496740	2010-04-13 11:31:30
2342	Additionally it is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.. Adult drakes depart the breeding grounds well before adult hens and immatures.\r\n	4851567464	2010-09-19 14:18:42
2343	The males court the females by rising and falling flight, calls, and nest building. The Ruffed Grouse population has a cycle, and follows the cycle no matter how much or how little hunting there is.\r\n	9568069349	2010-03-10 19:19:32
2344	The largest extant species is the Eurasian Black Vulture (Aegypius monachus), attaining a maximum size of 14 kg (31 lb), 1.2 m (3.9 ft) long and 3.1 m (10 ft) across the wings.

2345	The feet go from flesh-colored at hatching to grey to black, thence finally to yellow. At hatching, the young weigh somewhat more than an ounce (35 g) and are naked, but they soon grow sooty-grey down feathers.\r\n	5599824220	2010-02-13 20:56:17
2346	In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. In the 20th century, organochloride and heavy metal poisonings were also commonplace, but these have declined thanks to tighter regulations on pollution.\r\n	5779131690	2010-05-23 12:52:45
2347	This is perhaps a predator-avoidance behavior, since its small size makes the bittern vulnerable to many potential predators. This is a gregarious bird of freshwater wetlands, forming large winter roosts.\r\n	1625441526	2009-10-21 16:40:34
2348	Its scientific name of Fregata minor arose because when it was first discovered, it was thought to be a small pelican, and so named Pelecanus minor by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789.

2458	Some fully-fledged or adult birds observed to be hunted in flight or on the ground by Great Black-backed Gulls have included Anas ducks, Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis), Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), Manx Shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus), Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), Common Moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), terns, Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica), coots (Fulica ssp.), Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Glossy Ibises (Plegadis falcinellus) and even Rock Pigeons (Columba livia). Very large; bill long and stout, with narrow orange band..\r\n	5344071598	2009-10-19 14:39:23
2459	Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken and be pushed towards the periphery where they are in greater danger of predation. Hunting with lead shot, along with the use of lead sinkers in angling, has been identified as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects.\r\n	1433344000	2009-02-11 17:44:23

Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances.\r\n	8491038176	2010-06-10 12:50:33
2465	It is typically silent at sea, except for the soft purring sounds it sometimes makes in flight. The Eastern or Chinese Spot-billed Duck is currently introgressing into the Mallard populations of the Primorsky Krai, possibly due to habitat changes from global warming.\r\n	0199284917	2010-11-25 22:38:29
2466	The scant other data agrees with this, and at least in Central America the nesting season seems to run from March to June or so.. Though it occurs in the subarctic waters off Kamchatka and the Aleutian Islands, it is not documented from the subantarctic Pacific; this apparent absence might simply be due to the lack of study opportunities in the vast islandless region south of the Polynesian Triangle however.\r\n	9159803684	2010-11-18 14:16:26

2471	The species name sandvicensis refers to the Sandwich Islands, an old name for the Hawaiian Islands.. The heavy toll on breeding birds, together with loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, meant that the species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963.\r\n	5050068698	2009-01-14 22:15:13
2472	This species also may be perceived as a threat by farmers due to the similar Black Vulture s tendency to attack and kill newborn cattle. It can be quite common off the south-western coasts of Great Britain and Ireland before heading back south again, this time down the eastern littoral of the Atlantic..\r\n	8388776573	2010-10-18 13:34:40
2473	New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Birds, like the flamingo, have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals.\r\n	5541100834	2009-02-19 19:26:36
2474	It nests in a bush or on the ground, laying 34 eggs.. More commonly, birds fly between 60 and 100 m (200350 ft) above the ground, gliding or flapping at a rate of around 3.3 wingbeats a second..\r\n	9967062186	2010-06-22 15:58:51
2475	It has been seen that the medulla, hypothalamus and mid-brain are involved in the control of panting, as well through the Hering-Breuer reflex that uses stretch receptors in the lungs, and the vagus nerve. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms.\r\n	5894776625	2010-05-16 17:22:23

2487	Though the taxonomic distinctness of the Komandorski and Kuril Islands populations, which used to winter in Japan, is controversial, it is without doubt that they disappeared around 1929.. Like all flamingos, it lays a single chalky white egg on a mud mound, between May and August; incubation until hatching takes from 28 to 32 days; both parents brood the young for a period of up to 6 years when they reach sexual maturity.\r\n	4316475320	2010-07-24 13:48:32
2488	These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight; the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft.

2492	On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of terns and other seabirds. One hypothesis for the birds adaptation to respiratory alkalosis is tracheal coiling.\r\n	4569365559	2010-06-24 13:23:26
2493	A single egg is laid in a large nest, typically built on steep slopes or cliffs with tussock grass, and incubated for 72 days. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased..\r\n	9746874824	2010-11-15 19:39:55

5	Clark s Nutcracker	Malta	Flocks will often contain American Coots..	The White faced Whistling Duck is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.. The Black bellied Whistling Duck or Black bellied Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), formerly also called Black bellied Tree Duck, is a whistling duck that breeds from the southernmost United States and tropical Central to south central South America. In the USA, it can be found year round in parts of southeast Texas, and seasonally in southeast Arizona, and Louisiana s Gulf Coast. It is a rare breeder in such disparate locations as Florida, Arkansas, Georgia, and South Carolina. There is a large population of several hundred that winter each year in Audubon Park in uptown New Orleans, Louisiana.
1	Blue-gray Noddy	Philippines	About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to  fly  through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.. Most birds are diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during twilight hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night..	Specimens are known or assumed to be from an area which roughly corresponds to the middle elevations of today s Puna district around the present settlement of Mountain View, below the primary rainforest.. Specimens of the light form were collected in 1778 on the third Cook expedition; the dark form was supposedly not found at that time (but see above). Apparently, all or at least most specimens of the latter were procured over a short period around 1860 by James D. The last reliable sight record was in 1884, with a doubtful one in 1893; a dedicated search in 1887 failed to find the bird, but as it was rather cryptic, this cannot be taken as unequivocal proof that it was completely extinct by then.. As neither the Small Asian Mongoose nor mosquitoes (which transmit fowlpox and avian malaria, both exceptionally lethal to Hawaiian endemic birds) were present on Big Island until 1883 and the 1890s, respectively, this species  extinction was probably caused by introduced European rats, cats and possibly dogs. Hunting, sometimes assumed to have played a major part, probably was not significant as the bird was protected by a kapu which prohibited hunting except by ali?i until 1819 . After that, the few specimens that were collected suggest it was not extensively hunted even after the kapu were abolished.. The Hawaiian Coot (Fulica alai), also known as the ?alae kea in Hawaiian, is a bird in the rail family, Rallidae, that is endemic to Hawai?i.
2	Galapagos Petrel	Cape Verde	Bill broader based than in than M.	These plants served their purpose by re vegetating and protecting the soil. But these invaders became great competitors and directly affected native vegetation. In some instances crested wheatgrass and smooth brome have forced out native vegetation, creating monoculture habitats. Monoculture habitats are not favored by sharp tailed grouse, as they prefer sites with high heterogeneity. Hamerstrom (1939) was quoted as saying  More important than the individual cover plants is the fact that most of the nests of all species were in cover mixtures rather than pure stands. . Research conducted pre 1950 on sharp tailed grouse habitat assessment was done visually.
3	Swallow-tailed Kite	Mozambique	Birds are the only vertebrate animals to have a fused collarbone (the furcula or wishbone) or a keeled sternum or breastbone. The keel of the sternum serves as an attachment site for the muscles used for flight, or similarly for swimming in penguins. Again, flightless birds, such as ostriches, which do not have highly developed pectoral muscles, lack a pronounced keel on the sternum. It is noted that swimming birds have a wide sternum, while walking birds had a long or high sternum while flying birds have the width and height nearly equal.. Birds have uncinate processes on the ribs. These are hooked extensions of bone which help to strengthen the rib cage by overlapping with the rib behind them. This feature is also found in the tuatara Sphenodon. They also have a greatly elongate tetradiate pelvis as in some reptiles. The hindlimb has an intra tarsal joint found also in some reptiles. There is extensive fusion of the trunk vertebrae as well as fusion with the pectoral girdle. They have a diapsid skull as in reptiles with a pre lachrymal fossa (present in some reptiles). The skull has a single occipital condyle.. The skull consists of five major bones: the frontal (top of head), parietal (back of head), premaxillary and nasal (top beak), and the mandible (bottom beak).	But the eye area of the female is always darker, making the light eye stand out, while the male s head is altogether not very contrastingly colored and the female lacks the grey wing patch and tail.
4	Sprague s Pipit	Brunei Darussalam	All these species have generally black plumage with varying amounts of green and blue iridescence. The female plumage of the dimorphic species is typically drab to blend in with their habitat, unlike the bright attractive colors found on the males. Younger males of these species have female like plumage, and sexual maturity takes a long time, with the full adult plumage not being obtained for up to seven years. This affords the younger males the protection from predators of more subdued colours, and also reduces hostility from adult males.. Brown Sicklebills are montane species.	Albatrosses are highly philopatric, meaning they will usually return to their natal colony to breed. This tendency to return to their point of origin to breed is so strong that a study of Laysan Albatross showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m (72 ft).. Albatrosses live much longer than other birds, they delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. Albatrosses are very long lived; most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Northern Royal Albatross that was ringed as an adult and survived for another 51 years, giving it an estimated age of 61. Given that most albatross ringing projects are considerably younger than that, it is thought likely that other species will prove to live that long and even longer.. Albatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly, after about five years, but even once they have reached maturity, they will not begin to breed for another couple of years (even up to 10 years for some species).
6	Buff-fronted Foliage-gleaner	Lebanon	The majority of birds fly 20 to 40 miles per hour, depending on weather conditions. Ducks and geese generally fly in the 40 to 55 miles per hour range. There is great variation in flight speeds among the nearly 8,000 species of birds. Small songbirds like wrens and sparrows fly 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32 kilometers) per hour, while ducks, geese, and pigeons can fly at speeds up to 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour.	A 19 34% survival rate was estimated for juvenile eagles from Denali National Park in their first 11 months. The average life expectancy of Golden Eagles in Germany is 13 years, extrapolated from a reported mere 92.5% survival rate.. Natural sources of mortality are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, Golden Eagles have been killed by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned Wolverine, Snow Leopard, Cougar, Brown Bear and White tailed Eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other Golden Eagles. Nestlings and fledglings are more likely to be killed by another predator than free flying juveniles and adults.
7	Evening Grosbeak	Canada	The Turkey Vulture received its common name from the resemblance of the adult s bald red head and its dark plumage to that of the male Wild Turkey, while the name  vulture  is derived from the Latin word vulturus, meaning  tearer,  and is a reference to its feeding habits. The word buzzard is used by North Americans to refer to this bird, yet in the Old World this word refers to members of the genus Buteo. The generic term Cathartes means  purifier  and is the Latinized form from the Greek kathartes/?a?a?t??. The species name, aura, is Latinized from the Native Mexican word for the bird, auroura. The Turkey Vulture was first formally described by Linnaeus as Vultur aura in his Systema Naturae in 1758, and characterised as V. fuscogriseus, remigibus nigris, rostro albo ( brown gray vulture, with black wings and a white beak ). It is a member of the family Cathartidae, along with the other six species of New World vultures, and included in the genus Cathartes, along with the Greater Yellow headed Vulture and the Lesser Yellow headed Vulture. Like other New World vultures, the Turkey Vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.. The exact taxonomic placement of the Turkey Vulture and the remaining six species of New World Vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World Vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world.	Moreover they carry viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoans that can be transferred to other creatures for instance vertebrates and even Humans.. Eggs are generally laid in late May. They have their nests on the ground in thick grasses, tussocks, swamped shrubbery, or hidden in deadwood.
8	Blue-gray Noddy	Yemen	After moulting into the eclipse plumage, the upper head often has a grey hue, as blackish feathers grow between the small wispy white crest.. The bill is huge and flat on the top, with a large throat sac below, and, in the breeding season, is vivid orange in color as is the iris, the bare skin around the eye, and the feet.	Possible causes include loss of habitat due to hydroelectric projects and loss of life due to oil spills near coastal areas.. These birds feed by swimming under water or diving. They eat molluscs, crustaceans and insects.
9	Bristle-thighed Curlew	Palau	With adequate snow cover they will burrow under the snow. Like other forest creatures, the ruffed grouse will maintain trails through the underbrush and pines. These can often be found by looking for the feathers of the bird on the ground and on twigs at the edges of its trail. Hunting of the ruffed grouse requires a good ear and lots of stamina as you will be constantly walking and listening for them in the leaves.   Joseph B. Ruffed Grouse will frequently seek gravel and clover along road beds during early morning and late afternoon. These areas are good areas to walk during this time to flush birds. Also, grouse use sandy road beds to dust their feathers to rid themselves of skin pests. Dusting sites are visible as areas of disturbed soils with some signs of feathers. Birds will return to these spots during the late afternoon to bathe in dust and also socialize and mate.. The Ruffed Grouse population has a cycle, and follows the cycle no matter how much or how little hunting there is. The cycle has puzzled scientists for years, and is simply referred to as the  grouse cycle. .	This species occurs as a rare winter vagrant in Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of northern and western India.. Red necked Grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than 50 m (160 ft) between neighbouring nests, although semi colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites, where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory. Semi colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations, such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline. Such sites, safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection, have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders, down to 10 m (33 ft). Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods. The territory is defended with various threat displays, including wing spreading, hunching, and bill thrusting; pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive, less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating. Breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds..
10	Citrine Wagtail	Malawi	It is native to Canada and the United States, China, Mongolia, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain. It primarily occupies subalpine and subarctic habitats such as sparse pine and birch forests, thickets with willow and alder trees, heather moors, tundra and mountain slopes. In the winter, females and sub adults may move to lower altitudes and seek shelter in valleys or in more densely vegetated areas, but adult males usually remain in the subalpine region. The Red Grouse is common on heather clad moorland across the north and west of Great Britain and in localised areas of Ireland.. In Alaska, the main dietary item of the adults at all times of year is willows such as the Alaska willow Salix alaxensis, with leaves being eaten in summer and buds, twigs and catkins supplying the birds  main nutritional needs in winter and early spring.	Also, using different techniques, scientists have proven that they forage off the coast of southwestern Africa. Juveniles are also believe to go as far as the south Atlantic and the southwestern Indian Ocean.. Mollymawks are albatrosses in the family Diomedeidae and order Procellariiformes, which also includes shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. These birds share certain identifying features.
11	Island Canary	Japan	They may also stand still and wait to ambush prey.. The Western Reef Heron (Egretta gularis) also called the Western Reef Egret, is a medium sized heron found in southern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia. It has a mainly coastal distribution and occurs in two plumage forms, a slaty gray plumage in which it can only be confused with the rather uncommon dark morph of the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and a white form which can look very similar to the Little Egret although the bill tends to be paler and larger. There are also differences in size, structure and foraging behaviour. There have been suggestions that the species hybridizes with the Little Egret, and based on this, some authors treat schistacea and gularis as subspecies of Egretta garzetta. Works that consider the Western Reef Heron as a valid species include the nominate gularis and schistacea as subspecies.. This bird has two plumage colour forms.	They are migratory and most move east or west to coastal waters, also the Great Lakes. They are rare vagrants to western Europe, where they usually associate with the somewhat larger Black headed Gulls.. These birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming or wading. They mainly eat insects, crustaceans and fish. Unlike some other gulls, this bird rarely scavenges.. They are graceful in flight, more like terns.. They were named after Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte, a zoologist and nephew of Napoleon..
12	Royal Tern	Christmas Island	Black wing patches visible in flight. Black shouldered Kites are around 35 to 38 cm in length (13.8 to 15 in) and have a wingspan of between 80 and 95 cm (31.5 to 37.4 in) and an average weight of 291 grams (10.26 oz). Adults are a very pale grey with a white head and white underparts. The leading edge of the inner wing is black.	The tarsus measures 9.211.6 cm (3.64.6 in) in length, the bill 8.210.2 cm (3.24.0 in), averaging 9.1 cm (3.6 in). Bewick s Swan is similar in appearance to the parapatric Whooper Swan (C. cygnus), but is smaller, shorter necked and has a more rounded head shape, with variable bill pattern, but always showing more black than yellow and having a blunt forward edge of the yellow base patch. Whooper Swans have a bill that has more yellow than black and the forward edge of the yellow patch is usually pointed. The bill pattern for every individual Bewick s Swan is unique, and scientists often make detailed drawings of each bill and assign names to the swans to assist with studying these birds. The eastern birds, apart from being larger, tend towards less yellow on the bill, perhaps indicating that gene flow across Beringia, while marginal, never entirely ceased. An apparent case of hybridization between a Bewick s and a vagrant Whistling Swan has been reported from eastern Siberia..
13	Blue-throated Goldentail	Czech Republic	The chick takes about 160 days to fledge. This time investment by the parents may explain the long courtship; both parents want to be sure the other is serious. The chicks are fed a stomach oil by the parents.. The Laysan Albatross and the Black footed Albatross have been known to hybridize. Like all albatrosses, the Laysan Albatross is known to be a long living bird.	There is a yellow brown band over the eye and the legs are greenish yellow.. Their breeding habitat is wet meadows and shallow marshes across Canada east of the Rockies; also the northeastern United States and the entire northern US Canadian border Great Plains to the Great Lakes. A small population may exist in northern Mexico. The nest is a shallow cup built with marsh vegetation on damp ground under a canopy of dead plants.. The Yellow Rail migrates to the southeastern coastal United States.. The Yellow Rail are very elusive and seldom seen; when approached, they are more likely to rely on camouflage than flight. The bird s call, usually given at night, sounds like two stones being clicked together. Their numbers have declined in recent years due to loss of habitat..
14	Large-billed Tern	United Kingdom	Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the Kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour..	One cost of nocturnal migration is the loss of sleep. Migrants may be able to alter their quality of sleep to compensate for the loss.. Short distance and altitudinal migration. Many long distance migrants appear to be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, and may move in response to local weather conditions.
15	Golden-browed Chlorophonia	Ecuador	According to Mayan mythology, this god often carried messages between humans and the other gods. It is also used to represent Cozcacuauhtli, the thirteenth day of the month in the Mayan calendar (13 Reed). An Ocellated Turkey (Meleagris ocellata) was also considered to be the bird depicted, but the hooked bill and wattle point to the raptor.. The birds blood and feathers were also used to cure diseases. The King Vulture is also a popular subject on the stamps of the countries within its range.	The two independent nuclear introns indicated that these species diverged between 210,000 and 5,200,000 ybp, which did not overlap the predicted time for incomplete lineage sorting. These analyses also suggested that ancient introgression (similar to 14,000 ybp) has resulted in the widespread distribution and high frequency of falcated like mtDNA (5.5% of haplotypes) in North America. This is the first study to use a rigorous quantitative framework to reject incomplete lineage sorting as the cause of mitochondrial paraphyly.. Like one of many species of birds, the Falcated Duck migrates through the Atlantic Ocean. It has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 1,000,000 10,000,000 km2. Like 32 other species this bird flies from Eurasia to the eastern United States between the months of August and September. However, 32 species of birds is a small percentage of the population that actually migrate in between hemispheres. These migrations from country to country can cause some diseases (viruses)from insects such as mosquitoes, spread from Europe to North America. The infection happens when the mosquito bites one of the members of the ducks while in one place, for instance West Nile, and carry the infectious blood into the New World.
16	Ashy Storm-Petrel	Chile	Its favoured habitat is fresh or brackish coastal marshes, rice paddies and agricultural fields.. This species is gregarious, and at favoured sites substantial flocks can form.	Landowners as well as park and refuge managers can encourage Wood Ducks by building Wood Duck nest boxes near lakes, ponds, and streams. Fulda, Minnesota has adopted the Wood Duck as an unofficial mascot, and a large number of nest boxes can be found in the area.. The population of the Wood Duck has increased a great deal in the last several years. The increase has been due to the work of many people constructing Wood Duck boxes and conserving vital habitat for the Wood Ducks to breed. During the open waterfowl season, U.S.
17	Rose-breasted Grosbeak	Costa Rica	Its breeding distribution is in wetlands in warm temperate to tropical parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. In warmer locations, most birds are permanent residents; northern populations, including many European birds, migrate to Africa and southern Asia. They may also wander north in late summer after the breeding season, which may have assisted its current range expansion. Globally, the Little Egret is not listed as a threatened species..	The tail of the anhinga is wider and much longer than that of the cormorant. The bill of the anhinga is pointed, while the bill of the cormorant has a hook tip.. Unlike ducks, the Anhinga is not able to waterproof its feathers using oil produced by the uropygial gland. Consequently, feathers can become waterlogged, making the bird barely buoyant. However, this allows it to dive easily and search for underwater prey, such as fish and amphibians. It can stay down for significant periods.. When necessary, the Anhinga will dry out its wings and feathers, with the resemblance of the semicircular full spread shape of its group of tail feathers while drying them out, to that of true meleagrine males lending the name  water turkey  to it.
18	Antillean Euphonia	Qatar	If they are included, the largest species in the order, if measured in regard to body weight and wingspan, is the Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) of western South America. The great bird can reach a wingspan of 3.2 m (10.7 ft) and a weight of 15 kg (33 lb).. The longest bodied and tallest species in the order is probably the slender, towering Saddle billed Stork of Africa (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), which often exceeds 1.5 m (5 ft) tall and has a wingspan of up to 2.7 m (8.9 ft).Reaching a similar or slightly shorter height but more heavily built among the storks are the neotropical Jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), the Asian Greater Adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius) and the African Marabou Stork (L. crumeniferus), all of which are believed to weigh up to 8 to 9 kg (18 to 20 lb). The Greater Adjutant and Marabou nearly equal the Andean condor in maximum wingspan. All three are believed to reach or exceed 3.16 m (10.5 ft) and are regarded as having the largest wingspan of any landbirds (that is species who live over land as opposed to tied to the sea or wetlands). Standing up to 1.53 m (5.0 ft), with a wingspan of up to 2.3 m (7.5 ft) and a weight up to 5 kg (11 lb) is the AfricanGoliath Heron (Ardea goliath), the largest of the diverse and well known herons and egrets. insignis) is generally smaller, but gigantic, unverified juveniles have been reported to 8.5 kg (18.8 lb) and 1.58 m (5.2 ft).. Many of the largest flying birds in the fossil record may have been members of the Ciconiiformes.	Better protection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries allowed birds to return to most or all of their former range. More recently in the period from about 1960 up to the early 1980s, numbers declined significantly again in many areas, primarily due to lead poisoning from birds swallowing discarded fishing sinkers made from lead.
19	Gundlach s Hawk	Singapore	The Whooping Crane is endangered mainly as a result of habitat loss, although whoopers are also still illegally shot despite this being subject to substantial financial penalties and possible prison time.. At one time, the range for these birds extended throughout midwestern North America. In 1941, the wild population consisted of 21 birds. Conservation efforts have led to a population increase; as of April 2007 there were about 340 Whooping Cranes living in the wild, and another 145 living in captivity. The Whooping Crane is still one of the rarest birds in North America. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed that 266 Whooping Cranes made the migration to Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in 2007..	In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs; or as the rooster(cock) serves as a tangible vessel of Christ as in the gospel of Matthew, Mark and Luke in the New Testament with Christ speaking through the cock; or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin and Munin, two Common Ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin. In several civilizations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the  auspex  (from which the word  auspicious  is derived) watched their activities to foretell events. They may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: ??????, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the Common Peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. Some birds have also been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Maori s legendary Pouakai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans.. painted tiles with design of birds from Qajar dynasty. Birds have been featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early cave paintings. Birds were later used in religious or symbolic art and design, such as the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.
20	Royal Tern	El Salvador	It was called cozcacuauhtli in Nahuatl, derived from cozcatl  collar  and cuauhtli  bird of prey .. The exact systematic placement of the King Vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the King Vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.. The genus Sarcoramphus, which today contains only the King Vulture, had a wider distribution in the past. The Kern Vulture (Sarcoramphus kernense), lived in southwestern North America during the mid Pliocene (Piacenzian), some 3.52.5 million years ago).	As their common name implies, the Tundra Swan breeds in the Arctic and subarctic tundra, where they inhabit shallow pools, lakes and rivers. These birds, unlike Mute Swans (C. olor) but like the other Arctic swans, are migratory birds. The winter habitat of both subspecies is grassland and marshland, often near the coast; they like to visit fields after harvest to feed on discarded grains and while on migration may stop over on mountain lakes. According to National Geographic, when migrating these birds can fly at altitudes of 8 km (nearly 27,000 ft); Tundra Swan flocks usually fly in V formation.. bewickii extends across the coastal lowlands of Siberia, from the Kola Peninsula east to the Pacific.
21	Rufous-breasted Antthrush	Iraq	The White faced Storm Petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering, holding its wings motionless and at an angle into the wind it pushes itself off the water s surface in a succession of bounding jumps. Storm petrels also use dynamic soaring and slope soaring to travel over the ocean surface. Dynamic soaring is used mostly by the Hydrobatinae, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.	Its pale iris and streaked neck differentiates it from other quail like birds.. The Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus) is a small ground dwelling bird in the New World quail family. This species is the only one in the genus Oreortyx, which is sometimes included in Callipepla. This is not appropriate, however, as the Mountain Quail s ancestors have diverged from other New World quails earlier than the bobwhites, no later than 6 mya..
22	Northern Jacana	Estonia	In some areas the breeding population appears to be increasing, such as in Sweden, whereas on the fringes of its range, it is often becoming rare to non existent. In Great Britain the Common Crane became extirpated in the 17th century, but a tiny population now breeds again in the Norfolk Broads and is slowly increasing and a reintroduction has been underway since 2010 for the Somerset levels. In Ireland, it died out as a breeding species in the 18th century, but a flock of about 30 appeared in County Cork in November 2011, and a smaller flock a year later. It was additionally extirpated as a breeder from Italy in the late 1800s, from Austria around 1900, from Hungary by 1952 and from Spain by 1954. The remnant German breeding population is also a fraction of the size of the large numbers that once bred in the country.. The main threat to the species, and the primary reason for its decline in the Western Palearctic, comes from habitat loss and degradation, as a result of dam construction, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, and drainage of wetlands. Although it has adapted to human settlement in many areas, nest disturbance, continuing changes in land use, and collision with utility lines are still potential problems. Further threats may include persecution due to crop damage, pesticide poisoning, egg collection, and hunting. The Common Crane is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies..	Due to this, there is now a controversial scheme to extirpate the Ruddy Duck as a British breeding species; there have also been culling attempts in other European countries.. The Plain Chachalaca (Ortalis vetula) is a large bird in the Cracidae family.
23	Red-throated Caracara	Cayman Islands	This broad winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar Rough legged Buzzard (Buteo lagopus) and the only distantly related European Honey Buzzard (Pernis apivorus), which mimics the Common Buzzard s plumage for a degree of protection from Northern Goshawks.	A third type of male was first described in 2006; this is a permanent female mimic, the first such reported for a bird. About 1% of males are small, intermediate in size between males and females, and do not grow the elaborate breeding plumage of the territorial and satellite males, although they have much larger internal testes than the ruffed males. This cryptic male, or  faeder  (Old English  father ) obtains access to mating territories together with the females, and  steals  matings when the females crouch to solicit copulation. The faeder moults into the prenuptial male plumage with striped feathers, but does not go on to develop the ornamental feathers of the normal male. As described above, this stage is thought to show the original male breeding plumage, before other male types evolved. A faeder can be distinguished in the hand by its wing length, which is intermediate between those of displaying males and females. Despite their feminine appearance, the faeders migrate with the larger  normal  lekking males and spend the winter with them..
24	Kentucky Warbler	Cape Verde	versicolor) of Japan is sometimes placed as subspecies within the Common Pheasant.	Fossil bones of a very similar duck have been found in Early Pleistocene deposits at Dursunlu, Turkey. It is unresolved, however, how these birds were related to the Northern Shoveler of today; i.e., whether the differences noted were due to being a related species or paleosubspecies, or attributable to individual variation..
25	Colima Warbler	Bosnia and Herzegovina	In the summer, its throat is black. Juveniles have black and white stripes and look more like winter adults. This grebe does not have webbed feet. Its toes have lobes that come out of the side of each toe. These lobes allow for easy paddling. When flying, the feet appear behind the body due to the feet s placement in the far back of the body.. They are most commonly found throughout North America, Central America and South America year round. During the summer breeding season, they are most prevalent in central, northern and northeastern Canada.	Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) have the largest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to 12 feet (3.7 m). The albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but there is disagreement over the number of species.. Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion.
26	Wrentit	Lebanon	Insect prey commonly taken includes grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts. Other Buteo hawks in this species range, including smaller bodied species, do not normally prefer insects in their diet but instead focus on rodents and other small vertebrates. However, breeding birds switch mainly to capturing vertebrate prey, which pairs then bring to their nestlings. Breeding Swainson s Hawks rely heavily upon small mammals such as young ground squirrels, young cottontails, pocket gophers, mice, young jackrabbits, and, at least locally, small birds and other vertebrates including reptiles and amphibians.	The Western Gull is a large gull that can measure 55 to 68 cm (22 to 27 in) in total length, spans 130 to 144 cm (51 to 57 in) across the wings and weighs 800 to 1,400 g (1.8 to 3.1 lb). The average mass among a survey of 48 gulls of the species was 1,011 g (2.229 lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38 to 44.8 cm (15.0 to 17.6 in), the bill is 4.7 to 6.2 cm (1.9 to 2.4 in) and the tarsus is 5.8 to 7.5 cm (2.3 to 3.0 in). The Western Gull has a white head and body, and gray wings. It has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding).
27	Gray-breasted Woodpecker	Italy	This bird is found in humid tropical forests from southern Mexico and the Yucatn Peninsula, to Trinidad and Tobago, south to Peru and Argentina. They are able to tolerate some degree of habitat fragmentation, breeding successfully near cities and in forest fragments as small as 200 hectares (490 acres). Despite a slender build and a body weight no greater than a large Buteo hawk, the Ornate Hawk Eagle is a notably powerful predator which like other booted eagles can take prey up to 5 times its own weight. Prey items have ranged in size from 180 g (6.4 oz) to 8 kg (18 lbs) when taken. Prey species have included Little Blue Herons, curassows, toucans, wood quails, pigeons, macaws, parrots, cotingas, chickens and even a Black Vulture. Mammals are also significant prey, with agoutis, squirrels, rats, procyonids and monkeys often taken. Reptiles are also occasionally hunted.. The male s courtship display is a dive with folded wings, and a climb, sometimes completing a loop. The pair will touch talons in flight as the female rolls on her back. This species builds a large stick nest in a high tree (e.g. Ceiba), many meters above ground. The nest is around 1 meter (3 ft) in diameter.	Evidence for this includes quail individuals exhibiting preferential choice of sucrose containing solutions over simple distilled water and the avoidance of salty solutions.. Normally, the Japanese quail has been considered to possess an underdeveloped sense of taste, this being evidenced by their inability to distinguish different kinds of carbohydrates presented to them. However, more recent studies have shown that a limited ability to taste is indeed present. Evidence for this includes quail individuals exhibiting preferential choice of sucrose containing solutions over simple distilled water and the avoidance of salty solutions..
28	White-faced Whistling-Duck	East Timor (Timor-Leste)	During afforestation, the land is ploughed and in excess of 2,500 seedlings are planted per hectare, mainly with exotic conifers including Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The woodland canopy closes and ground vegetation dies, making these dark and gloomy places until harvesting in 40 to 50 years. More than 50% of land in Scotland at an elevation of 200600 m (6601,970 ft) has been planted as such. Afforestation requires removal of sheep and the fencing out or shooting deer, both important sources of carrion for Golden Eagles. Foraging areas of Golden Eagles have been confirmed to not include afforested areas.. Death by collisions with man made structures and objects can be serious local issue.	It also occurs on the Siberian side of the Bering Straits east of the Yana River.
29	Murphy s Petrel	Jordan	Foxes may prey on the same species in a given area but, as they are occasionally hunted by the eagles and are mainly nocturnal, they tend to avoid direct conflicts. Though rare, Golden Eagles may sometimes pirate prey from various species of fox. In North America, Coyotes (Canis latrans) may engages in agnostic interactions with Golden Eagles. Despite being around three times as heavy, lone coyotes are seemingly dominated by Golden Eagles at many carrion or kill sites. In the Greater Yellowstone, Golden Eagles were ranked as the second most dominant scavenger at wolf kills during winter (when bears are hibernating) after coyote packs but above Bald Eagles. In one instance, a healthy adult male coyote was attacked and killed by a Golden Eagle. This coyote weighed 13.5 kg (30 lb) after the eagle had consumed some of its internal organs. Conflicts between Golden Eagles and Scottish Wildcats have been reported on rare occasions. In one instance, a Golden Eagle trying to hunt some wildcat kittens was intercepted by the mother wildcat. In the ensuing violent battle, the wildcat mother and the eagle both died. In Northern California, Golden Eagles have pirated lambs killed by bobcats, a species which has itself occasionally turned up in the eagles diet. Per one anecdote from the Himalayas, a Golden Eagle reportedly tried to predaceously attack a Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia) and was killed by the much larger felid, although this could have actually been a case of an overly bold eagle trying to displace a large predator from its own home range. Adult wolverines appear to be one of the few conspecific mammal carnivores to actively pose a threat to Golden Eagles.	Female Chaffinches in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males do.. Most migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front.
30	Slaty-backed Forest-Falcon	Austria	In the summer the birds are largely brown, with dappled plumage, but in the winter they are white with some black feathers in their tails (British populations do not adopt a winter plumage). The species has remained little changed from the bird that roamed the tundra during the Pleistocene. Nesting takes place in the spring when clutches of four to ten eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground. The chicks are precocial and soon leave the nest and while they are young, both parents play a part in caring for them. The chicks eat insects and young plant growth while the adults are completely herbivorous, eating leaves, flowers, buds, seeds and berries during the summer and largely subsisting on the buds and twigs of willow and other dwarf shrubs and trees during the winter.. The Willow Ptarmigan is a medium to large ground dwelling bird and is the most numerous of the three species of ptarmigan. Males and females are about the same size, the adult length varying between 35 and 44 centimetres (14 and 17 in) with a wingspan ranging from 60 and 65 centimetres (24 and 26 in). The weight is 430 to 810 grams (15 to 29 oz).	The Ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as the main energy source for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.. Males display during the breeding season at a lek in a traditional open grassy arena. The Ruff is one of the few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males rather than to the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare, recently discovered variant with female like plumage. The territorial males, about 84% of the total, have strongly coloured black or chestnut ruffs and stake out and occupy small mating territories in the lek.
31	Gray-chested Dove	Belarus	Indeed, the monsoons of India are preceded by the arrival of the Jacobin Cuckoo, the  harbinger of the monsoon . Other examples include the Woodland Kingfisher of west Africa and many Australian birds.. There are a few species, notably cuckoos, which are genuine long distance migrants within the tropics. An example is the Lesser Cuckoo, which breeds in India and spends the non breeding season in Africa. Such examples help make the case that food supplies, not weather per se, drive migration patterns.. Altitudinal migration is common on mountains worldwide, such as in the Himalayas and the Andes. Quite often, altitudinal migration is combined with distance migration; for example, the Himalayan Kashmir Flycatcher and Pied Thrush both move as far south as the highlands of Sri Lanka. Altitudinal migration may even be important to birds living on relatively small islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, which have high mountains.. Sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range. Bohemian Waxwings well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000.	Adult drakes depart the breeding grounds well before adult hens and immatures.
32	Rufous-vented Ground-Cuckoo	 Korea, Democratic People s Rep. (North Korea) 	The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with grass and down, usually surrounded by vegetation.. Blue winged Teal generally lay 10 to 12 eggs. Delayed nesting and renesting efforts have substantially smaller clutches, averaging five to six eggs. Clutch size can also vary with the age of the hen. Yearlings tend to lay smaller clutches. Blue winged Teal are sexually mature after their first winter. During incubation, the drake leaves its mate and moves to suitable molting cover where it becomes flightless for a period of 3 to 4 weeks.. Blue winged Teal ducklings can walk to water within 12 hours after hatching but do not fledge until 6 to 7 weeks..	They are fed by the female for three or four days, but can find their own food thereafter. The juveniles fledge after 3438 days. The second brood is started about 42 days after the first, and the incubation period is slightly shorter at 1618 days. The grown young may stay with the female until departure for Africa.. Nest success in undisturbed sites is high, at 8090%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land.
33	Fish Crow	Montenegro	In flight, the fast, twisting flocks resemble waders.. This is the smallest North American dabbling duck. The breeding male has grey flanks and back, with a yellow rear end and a white edged green speculum, obvious in flight or at rest. It has a chestnut head with a green eye patch. It is distinguished from drake Common Teals (the Eurasian relative of this bird) by a vertical white stripe on side of breast, the lack of both a horizontal white scapular stripe and the lack of thin buff lines on its head.. The females are light brown, with plumage much like a female Mallard. They can be distinguished from most ducks on size, shape, and the speculum.	Parents may leave the nest for significant periods of time during the night, possibly to evade nocturnal predators. It is unclear whether this is for self protection or to protect the eggs by diverting attention from the nest; the clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment, whatever the reason.. The Red necked Grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs, which average 3.4 cm (1.3 in) in breadth, 5.1 cm (2.0 in) in length, and weigh about 30.5 g (1.08 oz), of which 10% is shell. Parents take turns to incubate the eggs for 2133 days until the precocial downy chicks hatch; they immediately climb onto the parent s back, where they spend most of their time until they are 1017 days old. The young may be fed by the parents for up to 54 days after fledging, and can fly at 5070 days. The parents do not interfere with the feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried. Later they care for the younger chicks for longer, and are aggressive with the older offspring.
34	Red-cheeked Cordonbleu	Faroe Islands	The male is smaller and has a proportionally larger tail, which enables the male to fish in shallow areas as well as deep waters. The female is larger and can carry more food. Both the male and female feed the chicks through regurgitation.. The Blue footed Booby is one of only two species of Booby that raises more than one chick in a breeding cycle..	While flying, the broadness and shortness of the wings become apparent. While in flight, the bird s tail is typically kept closed.. Though light and small compared to other eagles, this bird is a powerful predator that frequently hunts relatively large prey. It mainly eats large rodents, opossums and monkeys, as well as, occasionally, bats and birds.
35	White-tailed Hawk	Estonia	Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotis), Swift Fox (Vulpes velox), Gray Fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the Golden Eagles diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. Everything in this diverse family from Least Weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to Wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, have turned up as prey in Golden Eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the American Marten (Martes americanus), Pine Marten (Martes martes) and Beech Marten. The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian Otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian Badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst Wolverines, young and inexperienced specimens are usually targeted as prey by Golden Eagles. In North America, full grown large mustelids, including American Badgers (Taxidea taxus) and Fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska.	It should be noted that Swainson s Hawk was removed from the active Federal list because it was found to be more abundant than previously thought; it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.
36	Scott s Oriole	Palestinian territories	For example, females of nearly all shorebirds have longer bills than males of the same species, and female American Avocets have beaks which are slightly more upturned than those of males. Males of the larger gull species have bigger, stouter beaks than those of females of the same species, and immatures can have smaller, more slender beaks than those of adults. Many hornbills show sexual dimorphism in the size and shape of both beaks and casques, and the female Huia s slim, decurved bill was nearly twice as long as the male s straight, thicker one..	An all white population found only in the Caribbean and southern Florida was once treated as a separate species and known as the Great White Heron.. The Great Blue Heron was one of the many species originally described by Carolus Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae..
37	Bahama Woodstar	Poland	Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching.	The young is duller with smaller horn, and has brown tail and wings.. The only member in monotypic genus Oreophasis, the Horned Guan is distributed in humid mountain forests of southeast Mexico (Chiapas) and Guatemala of Central America. It is found in altitude up to 3,350 metres. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, green leaves and invertebrates. The female usually lays up to two eggs.. The Horned Guan is not a true guan, but merely resembles these birds most in overall shape and color, whereas the horn is more reminiscent of the helmeted curassows. In fact, this species is the only survivor of a very ancient lineage of cracids that has been evolving independently from all other living members of this family for at least 20, possibly as much as 40 million years.. Although it does not have any really close relatives among living cracids, the true guans are apparently most distant.
38	Japanese Bush-Warbler	Andorra	Pleistocene remains have been recovered from Buenos Aires Province in central Argentina, over 700 km (450 mi) south of its current range, giving rise to speculation on the habitat there at the time which had not been thought to be suitable.. The King Vulture soars for hours effortlessly, only flapping its wings infrequently.	They stalk their prey in shallow water, often running with raised wings or shuffling its feet to disturb small fish.
39	Common Scoter	Solomon Islands	One source states that adult females can weigh up to 10 kg (22 lb). An exceptionally large captive female,  Jezebel , weighed 12.3 kg (27 lb). Being captive, this large female may not be representative of the weight possible in wild Harpy Eagles due to differences in the food availability. The male, in comparison, is much smaller and weighs only about 4 to 4.8 kg (8.8 to 10.6 lb). Harpy Eagles are 86.5107 cm (2 ft 10 in3 ft 6 in) long and have a wingspan of 176 to 224 cm (5 ft 9 in to 7 ft 4 in). Among the standard measurements, the wing chord measures 5463 cm (1 ft 9 in2 ft 1 in), the tail measures 3742 cm (1 ft 3 in1 ft 5 in), the tarsus is 11.413 cm (4.55.1 in) long and the exposed culmen from the cere is 4.2 to 6.5 cm (1.7 to 2.6 in).. It is sometimes cited as the largest eagle alongside the Philippine Eagle, that is somewhat longer on average and the Steller s Sea Eagle, that is slightly heavier on average. The wingspan of the Harpy Eagle is relatively small, an adaptation that increases maneuverability in forested habitats and is shared by other raptors in similar habitats. The wingspan of the Harpy Eagle is surpassed by several large eagles who live in more open habitats, such as those in the Haliaeetus and Aquila genera. The extinct Haast s Eagle was significantly larger than all extant eagles, including the Harpy..	Cavity dwelling species have to contend with the danger of predators accessing their nest, catching them and their young inside and unable to get out. They have a variety of methods for decreasing the likelihood of this happening. Red cockaded Woodpeckers peel bark around the entrance, and drill wells above and below the hole; since they nest in live trees, the resulting flow of resin forms a barrier that prevents snakes from reaching the nests.
40	Thick-billed Euphonia	Iran (Islamic Republic of)	The fan shaped crest on the head is made of feathers with bare black shafts and tipped with blush green webbing.	In the southern reaches of the species breeding range, i.e. Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, males average 1,050 g (2.31 lb) and females average 1,231 g (2.714 lb). In the northern stretches of the breeding range, in southern Canada, Washington, Idaho and North Dakota, the hawks are heavier averaging 1,163 g (2.564 lb) in males and 1,776 g (3.915 lb) in females.. Adults have long broad wings and a broad gray, rusty, or white tail. The legs are feathered to the talons, like the Rough legged Hawk. Light morph birds are rusty brown on the upper parts and pale on the head, neck, and underparts with rust on the legs and some rust marking on the underwing. The  Ferruginous  name refers to the rusty color of the light morph birds.. Dark morph birds are dark brown on both upperparts and underparts with light areas on the upper and lower wings.. The voice is not well described in literature.
41	Black-capped Gnatcatcher	Morocco	The Masked Booby nests in small colonies, laying two chalky white eggs on sandy beaches in shallow depressions, which are incubated by both adults for 45 days.	There is a rare hypermelanic morph with largely dark plumage.
42	Sharpbill	France	Some eggs are plain; others are lightly marked with spots and blotches of light brown. The incubation period is 34 to 35 days, with the female incubating while the male brings food..	The Greater Scaup (Aythya marila), just Scaup in Europe, or colloquially  Bluebill  in North America for its bright blue bill, is a mid sized diving duck though it is larger than the closely related Lesser Scaup. It is a circumpolar species, which means that its range circles one of Earth s poles. It spends the summer months breeding in Alaska, northern Canada, Siberia, and the northernmost reaches of Europe. During the winter, it migrates south down the coasts of North America, Europe, and Japan.. Drake Greater Scaup are larger and have more rounded heads than females; they have a bright blue bill and yellow eyes. They have dark heads with a glossy green tint, white undersides and wings with white on the tips. The females are mostly brown, with white bands located on their wingtips. They have a blue bill that is slightly duller then the drake s..
43	Streaked Flycatcher	Belgium	However, the two species can be differentiated by their tails and bills. The tail of the anhinga is wider and much longer than that of the cormorant. The bill of the anhinga is pointed, while the bill of the cormorant has a hook tip.. Unlike ducks, the Anhinga is not able to waterproof its feathers using oil produced by the uropygial gland. Consequently, feathers can become waterlogged, making the bird barely buoyant. However, this allows it to dive easily and search for underwater prey, such as fish and amphibians. It can stay down for significant periods..	It winters further south in temperate zones, on the coasts of the northern USA and Canada, on the Pacific coast south to the San Francisco Bay region and on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, and in Asia as far south as China.. Some birds may over winter on the Great Lakes. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe; only drakes are safely identifiable out of range, so females are likely to be undetected.. This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs while migrating or wintering on the sea coasts, and feeds on insects and their larvae, especially caddisflies, fish eggs and, more rarely, vegetation such as duck weed while nesting on freshwater. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters in winter quarters.
44	American Avocet	Austria	It is approximately the same size as C. foetens, but its plumage is not as dark. Its range stretches from northern Mexico through Texas and the southern United States north to New Jersey and Pennsylvania.. brasiliensis, named by Charles Lucien Jules Laurent Bonaparte in 1850, is known as the Southern American Black Vulture. The light markings on the undersides of the primaries are whiter and broader than those of the other subspecies, and the underwing coverts are lighter than those of C. It is found in Central America and northern South America. To the south, the range extends to the coastal regions of Peru on the west and the lowlands of Bolivia on the east. To the north, it stretches to Sonora in western Mexico and San Luis Potos in eastern Mexico. It is not found in high altitude regions..	The gene FOXP2, defects of which affect both speech production and comprehension of language in humans, becomes highly expressed in Area X during periods of vocal plasticity in both juvenile Zebra Finches and adult canaries.. Auditory feedback in birdsong learning. Early experiments by Thorpe in 1954 showed the importance of a bird being able to hear a tutor s song. When birds are raised in isolation, away from the influence of conspecific males, they still sing. While the song they produce, called  isolate song , resembles the song of a wild bird, it shows distinctly different characteristics from the wild song and lacks its complexity. The importance of the bird being able to hear itself sing in the sensorimotor period was later discovered by Konishi.
45	Swainson s Thrush	Saint Kitts and Nevis	However, there are a few species which do not have egg teeth. Megapode chicks have an egg tooth while still in the egg but lose it before hatching, while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way out. Most chicks lose their egg teeth within a few days of hatching, though petrels keep theirs for nearly three weeks and Marbled Murrelets have theirs for up to a month.	The black tips to the primary wing feathers have conspicuous white  mirrors . The underwing is dark grey with black wingtips. The grey hood is lost in winter, leaving just dark streaks..
46	Ruddy Pigeon	Cook Islands	This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding for the first time usually return to their natal colony, and often nest very close to where they hatched. Individual nesting sites at seabird colonies can be widely spaced, as in an albatross colony, or densely packed like an auk colony. In most seabird colonies several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation.	The population of the Atitln Grebe declined from 200 individuals in 1960 to 80 in 1965.
47	Paint-billed Crake	Serbia	In Europe, Golden Eagles are relatively minor predators of owls compared to Eurasian Eagle Owls and Northern Goshawks. The primary owls hunted by European eagles are Ural Owls (Strix uralensis) and Short eared Owls (Asio flammeus).	In Labrador the Puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, they were able to adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.. The chicks take from 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period depending on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces over the last few days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx Shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest.
48	Brambling	Samoa	columbianus: the Columbian Sharp tailed Grouse can be found in isolated pockets of native sagebrush and bunchgrass plains of Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and British Columbia..	This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.. In natural settings, the Black Vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas populated by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals.
49	Sinaloa Martin	Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa)	However, markings on the throat and breast, as well as the particular shade of brown of the plumage, can vary quite a bit. The breast feathers of females are littered with dark spots among generally pale feathers. Contrastingly, male breast feathers show off a uniform dark reddish brown color that is devoid of any dark spots. This reddish brown coloration also appears in the male cheek, while female cheek feathers are more cream colored. Some males also exhibit the formation of a white collar, whereas this does not occur in any female members of the species.	Typical vegetation is stunted, fragmented larch woodland merging into low birch willow scrub and various heathland. In the rocky, wet, windy maritime countries of the British Isles and western Scandinavia, the Golden Eagle is a mountain dwelling bird. These areas include upland grasslands, blanket bog and sub Arctic heaths but also fragmented woodland and woodland edge, including boreal forests.
50	Yellow-billed Tern	 Korea, Democratic People s Rep. (North Korea) 	Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic Skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses Puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.. Both the Guillemot tick Ixodes uriae and the flea Ornithopsylla laetitiae (probably originally a rabbit flea) have been recorded from the nests of Puffins. Other fleas which have been found on the birds include Ceratophyllus borealis, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Ceratophyllus garei, Ceratophyllus vagabunda and the common rabbit flea Spilopsyllus cuniculi.. In flight over the Isle of May, Scotland. In its Red List of Threatened Species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Atlantic Puffin as being of  Least Concern . It has a very large total population and an extensive range which covers over 1,620,000 square kilometres (630,000 sq mi). Although the number of birds seems to be decreasing, the decline does not reach the threshold for  Vulnerable  status. Some of the causes of population decline may be increased predation by gulls and skuas, the introduction of rats, cats, dogs and foxes onto some islands used for nesting, contamination by toxic residues, drowning in fishing nets, declining food supplies and climate change.	Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species.
